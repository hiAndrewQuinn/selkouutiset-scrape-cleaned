The Danes have a new king. He is Frederik X.

Frederik became the king of Denmark today, Sunday. A large crowd watched as the Danish Prime Minister officially introduced the new king to the Danes from the palace balcony.

The Danes cheered the king and the king's consort Mary. Queen Mary is from Australia.

The royal family is very popular in Denmark. The king has no power, but he is an important symbol for Danes.

## Queen Margaret

Frederik became king because Queen Margaret II abdicated. 83-year-old Margareeta is the previous ruler of Denmark and Frederik's mother.

Finns also got to know Margareta. The Queen visited Finland many times.

Margareeta visited Finland in 2017, for example, when independent Finland turned 100 years old. Margareeta congratulated Finland and praised Finland's nature and mummies.

Margareeta also said that Finland and the other Nordic countries are one family.

## The Nordic countries

Danish royals are of interest to many Finns because Denmark is a familiar country. Danes have a very similar culture and similar values to Finns.

All the Nordic countries, i.e. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, have a lot of common history. About 600 years ago, the Nordic countries were one country ruled by Queen Margaret I.

Today, the close relationship between the Nordic countries can be seen in many things. For example, citizens of the Nordic countries can get Finnish citizenship after they have lived in Finland for 2 years. Others require 5 years.

## Repeat

This time the topic of Uutisvikio has been that the Danes have a new king. Let's repeat the most important things.

The new king of Denmark is Frederik X.

The ruler changed because Queen Margaret abdicated.

Denmark is a familiar country to many Finns, because Finland and Denmark are both Nordic countries.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
