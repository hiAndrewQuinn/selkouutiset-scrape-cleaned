Naima Mohamud's family moved from Somalia to Finland in 1990. Mohamud was 2 years old at the time.

The family lived in Mikkeli, Järvenpää, Jyväskylä and Helsinki.

Naima Mohamud wanted to be a director even as a teenager.

He borrowed scriptwriting guides from the library and at the age of 14 offered a film idea based on the book Tähkäyö. At the age of 15, he offered Yle a script for a short film.

There were no contracts yet, but the experience was gained.
