Finnish money

The topic of the news week this time is Finnish money and economy.

Finland's economy is doing worse than it was thought in the spring.

This week, new information was received about the economy.

Now more about the situation of the Finnish economy. It affects everyone's life.

## 12 billion new debt

The situation of the Finnish economy is weak.

Next year, Finland's spending will be 88 billion euros.

Revenues are only 76 billion euros.

That is why Finland is taking on new debt of more than 12 billion euros.

There are many reasons for the bad situation of the Finnish economy.

Perhaps the most important reason is that there are too few successful companies in Finland.

The situation of many big Finnish companies is bad.

## My own money is not enough

This week we received new information about the financial situation in Finland.

Finland has a lot of debt. The amount of debt has been growing for many, many years.

There can be problems with debt if there is too much debt.

That is why the government wants to reduce the amount of debt

At the same time, Finland has large public services.

It means that the state pays a large part of, for example, healthcare.

Hospitals, health centers and the salaries of doctors and nurses cost a lot.

A lot of money also goes to unemployment support, housing support, income support and many other supports.

Finland spends more money on various subsidies than many other countries.

Finland has paid the services and subsidies with debt money, because Finland's own money is not enough.

## Expecting better

Finland has waited a long time for its economy to improve. There are small signs of it.

For example, companies in the technology sector believe that better times are ahead.

Today they still have a bad situation. Their customers have ordered only a few products.

Orders have been decreasing for over a year now.

The companies still trust that maybe at the end of this year things will change for the better.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was the Finnish economy. Let's repeat the most important things.

Finland is having problems with the economy.

Finland's big companies are not successful and there is a lot of debt.

There may be small signs of better things.

This was a news week in plain Finnish. See you again, by the way!
