Unemployment. Wolves. Frost. Weather.

## Unemployment in Finland has worsened

First, unemployment.

Finland's unemployment rate is now the highest in Europe, at 10.6 percent.

It is now even higher than in Spain. At the same time, unemployment has generally decreased in other EU countries.

The researcher says that the Finnish economy has not yet improved after the coronavirus epidemic.

Finland's unemployment rate is the highest in the EU, but the number of people in work increased by around 25,000 last year.

The Ministry of Labor predicts that unemployment will begin to decline this year.

## Wolf hunting and research

Then the news about the wolves.

This year, 100 wolves can be killed. The new hunting law states that wolves are no longer protected year-round.

They have already been handed over to the Natural Resources Institute Finland for research.

A DNA sample determines whether it is a wolf or a canid. A canid is a cross between a wolf and a dog.

This year, you can kill 100 wolves.

DNA tells which pack the animal belonged to. This helps to determine whether hunting has reduced the number of wolves and how hunting affects the number of wolves.

## The frost is intense

Finally, from the frost.

The frost record has been broken again.

The lowest temperature of the current winter was measured this morning in Tulppio, eastern Lapland, Savukoski. The temperature was -42.8 degrees.

Not everyone is bothered by the cold. That's what **Ronja Berlin** says in Rovaniemi, Lapland.

\- I really like it. This is my first season in Lapland, so I'm making the most of this cold weather. Just put on some clothes and don't go outside.

The transmission grid company Fingrid says that an all-time record has been set in electricity consumption in Finland.

The price of electricity has remained reasonable because there has been a lot of wind power available.

**Mirjami Kaakinen** from Rovaniemi doesn't mind the bitter cold. They walk along their own paths in the forest enclosure.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will also be cold throughout the country tomorrow.

The sun shines in the west and north.

It will be cloudy in the east and there may be a little snow in places.

In the south, the weather feels cold because of the wind.
