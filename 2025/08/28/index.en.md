Forest certificate. Dependencies. Illustration exhibition. Weather.

## Forest certificate

First, the topic is wood.

A new certificate is coming to the forestry sector.

A certificate is a document that confirms that the forest owner has cut down the tree in an environmentally friendly manner.

For example, many European furniture companies are concerned about environmental impacts. They do not want to buy trees if the forest owner is clear-cutting. In clear-cutting, the forest owner cuts down almost all the trees in the area.

## Dependencies

Now the topic is addiction.

Various addictions cause problems in the workplace.

Addictions include alcohol addiction, drug addiction, or gambling addiction. Hannu Jouhki from the A-clinic Foundation says that people's addictions cost workplaces at least 500 million euros each year.

Various addictions cause problems in the workplace.

Kati, an office worker in her 30s, got hooked on online casinos. She was addicted to gambling:

*-I did it in the mornings as soon as I woke up, in secret. I did it constantly at work, and I did it a lot in the evenings too. So I didn't get much sleep at night and it was a disgusting time.*

## Illustration exhibition

Next, culture.

There is an exhibition at the Helsinki Art Hall featuring illustrations for children's books. The exhibition features works by 10 illustrators.

The exhibition presents different ways of illustrating children's books.

Jenni Erkintalo has done many illustrations for various books. Colors are important to her:

*-I guess my color palette is unique. Colors are really important to me, and then you notice that the same colors can be repeated in different books.*

An exhibition of children's book illustrations is on display at the Helsinki Art Hall. The exhibition is open until mid-September.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Friday, it will rain in the south. Elsewhere in Finland, the day will be sunny. The temperature will be around 15 degrees during the rain. In the central and northern parts of the country, the temperature will be between 15 and 20 degrees.
