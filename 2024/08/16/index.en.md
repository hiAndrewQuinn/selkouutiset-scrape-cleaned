## Oats are being experimentally cultivated in Lapland

Then the topic is oat farming.

Dozens of different oat varieties are being experimentally cultivated in Lapland this summer.

With the help of trial cultivation, we want to find out the varieties that are most successful in the north. Experimental cultivation provides information on, for example, how the length of the day affects grain growth, or how different varieties withstand heavy rain.

Dozens of different oat varieties are being experimentally grown in Tervola, southwestern Lapland.

Natural Resources Center researcher Juho Hautsalo says that due to climate change, grains can now be grown further north than before.

Oats have been chosen as a test grain because it has good health effects, its consumption is increasing, and it is a sustainable crop.

## Food by drone

Then we'll see how food deliveries go with a drone.

This drone flies layered burgers to Espoo's Suurpelto.

This is a test by the food delivery company Foodora, where they try to deliver food to a customer with a drone.

Foodora CEO Jacob Segercranz says that in the future, drone transport may be used if goods need to be delivered to, for example, an archipelago or a rural area.

This drone can carry 3 kilograms of stuff about 80 kilometers away.
