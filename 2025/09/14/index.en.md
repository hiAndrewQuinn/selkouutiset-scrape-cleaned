## Self-centered thinking

Working life puts a greater psychological burden on many people than before.

One reason is the increase in self-centered thinking.

This is what **Jan Schugk**, Chief Physician of the Pension Insurance Company Varma, says.

Self-centered thinking means that a person thinks about their own interests more than the common good.

People also over-explore their own emotions. This is especially evident among young workers.

Chief Physician Schugk says that self-centeredness has increased mental health illness absences.

## Feelings

Research professor **Ari Väänänen** at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health says that well-being is an important part of work results. That is why there is a lot of talk about emotions and their management now.

Chief Psychiatrist **Riittakerttu Kaltiala** says that the internet has a negative impact on people's thinking.

There are many tests and discussions online that make a person believe that they have a disorder or that they cannot work.

People reinforce other people's thinking online. This is a harmful phenomenon.

## Work pressures

Working life is changing rapidly. Work is now more complex than before.

Work consists of many small things more than before.

Many people experience pressure because they have to constantly learn new things, collaborate with others, and manage their own emotions.

New demands in working life have come to all sectors.

## Responsibility

Research Professor Väänänen says that the greatest responsibility lies with employers and workplaces.

Workplaces can improve, for example, orientation and work arrangements so that coping skills improve.

Employees also have responsibilities, but employees cannot influence things much.

The demands of working life are increasing, and this increases the workload on people.

People are also thinking more about their own well-being than before. However, examining one's own mind too much can hinder a person's coping skills.
