The border between Finland and Russia will be closed again. The border will be closed on Friday evening.

Finland opened 2 border crossings to Russia today, Thursday.

However, asylum seekers started coming from Russia as soon as the border was opened. Therefore, Finland decided to close the border again.

Finland closed the entire eastern border for the first time 2 weeks ago. The reason was that Russia sent asylum seekers to the Finnish border. Russia wanted to disturb Finland in this way, and Finland decided to block Russia's actions.

### Defense agreement

US soldiers are coming to Finland. Finland opens up military areas in different parts of Finland for US troops.

This is what the defense agreement concluded by Finland and the USA says. The Finnish government approved the agreement today, Thursday, and Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen will sign it on Monday in the USA.

Häkkänen says that the agreement is important for Finland's security. It ensures that Finland receives help in a crisis situation.

Based on the agreement, the USA can also store weapons in Finland. There is still no exact information on how many US soldiers will come to Finland.

Thursday has been strike day in Finland. There have been strikes in different sectors. For example, trains and many buses have stopped due to strikes.

There have also been strikes elsewhere than in traffic. Work has stopped, for example, in some paper factories.

Workers' unions organize strikes because they are angry with the Finnish government. The government intends to weaken social security and workers' rights.
