Private healthcare prices. HUS savings. Midsummer accidents. Art hall. Weather.

## Concentration of health services

The concentration of the private health sector has increased prices. This is what the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority says. Private medical services are focused on large companies. They are Terveystalo, Mehil√§inen and Pihlajalinna.

Already 65 percent of Finland's private medical sector is in large medical centers.

The concentration of the private health sector has increased prices by 10 to 20 percent. The biggest increase is, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging.

Large medical centers say that legislation and development work increase the prices of services.

The Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority says that, in addition, many shops of medical firms fall outside the supervision of the authorities.

## HUS savings

Then about medical care.

The savings affect HUS's cuts.

HUS is Finland's largest provider of specialized medical care. HUS operates in Uusimaa and with public money.

HUS's cost-saving measures threaten to lengthen the surgery queues of thousands of patients. The situation is difficult, for example, in neurosurgery and spine surgery.

The savings affect HUS's cuts. In addition, HUS has imposed a recruitment ban due to savings, i.e. new staff cannot be hired.

## Midsummer accidents

Then from Midsummer.

During Midsummer, five people have drowned and three have died in traffic.

Midsummer is a big midsummer celebration in Finland.

The Finnish Swimming Teaching and Lifesaving Association says that an average of 6 people have drowned during the last 10 midsummer holidays.

Among other things, the weather affects the number of drowning deaths.

## Art hall

More about art.

Helsinki Art Hall's main summer exhibition presents the work of sculptor Tommi Toija.

Toija's hallmark is the humorous sculptural figures, which also show the darker sides of life.

The special feature of the exhibition is Toija's study, which has been brought to Taidehalli.

## Weather

Finally, the weather forecast.

Tomorrow the sun will shine almost all over the country.

It is hot in the south and west - i.e. the temperature is over 25 degrees.

In the east and north, the temperature is around 20 degrees. It can rain a little in Northern Lapland.
