Party support. Tiktok. Warm April. Weather.

## Party support

First, politics.

The Social Democratic Party (SDP) is still the most popular party in Finland, according to a new poll conducted by Yle.

The SDP is now supported by over 25 percent of Finns.

The Prime Minister's party, the Coalition Party, is the second most popular party, supported by around 20 percent of Finns.

The Center Party has overtaken the Finns Party and is the third most popular party, with support of over 15 percent.

The Finns Party is fourth, but its support has collapsed to around 11 percent.

The opposition parties SDP and the Centre Party have seen the most increase in support.

Support for the ruling parties has now fallen below 40 percent.

## Tiktok data center

Then the topic is Tiktok's data center.

Minister of Economic Affairs Wille Rydman opposes the entry of Chinese TikTok into Finland.

Yesterday it was announced that social media service Tiktok will open a data center in Kouvola, southeast Finland. The data center will be built by Finnish company Hyperco.

The billion-dollar project has been in preparation for a long time, but the Ministry of Employment and the Economy was only informed about it in the final stages.

Rydman hopes that Tiktok's data center will be reconsidered.

Supo has previously warned that Tiktok users' data could end up with Chinese security authorities.

## Warm April

Finally, the topic of climate.

April was the second warmest April on record worldwide.

The EU Climate Service reports that the global average temperature in April was around 15 degrees.

In Europe, April was the sixth warmest on record.

The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that April was also broadly warmer than usual in Finland.

However, the temperature fluctuations were large. The highest temperature in April was almost 23 degrees Celsius and the lowest was almost -24 degrees Celsius.

## Friday weather

Forecast.

There may be some light rain in places in the southern and central parts of the country tomorrow, but generally there will be no rain.

It is cloudy and quite cool throughout the country.
