EU elections. Road construction sites. Cityscape change. Weather.

## EU elections

First, about the EU elections.

Finland's EU election candidates, i.e. MEP candidates, have a different opinion on climate refugees.

In Yle's election machine, the MP candidates answer the question whether Europe should accept climate refugees, i.e. people who leave their home region due to climate change.

About 60 percent of the candidates are of the opinion that Europe should accept climate refugees.

Yle's election machine allows you to see the candidates' opinions on many other issues as well.

The EU elections will be held on June 9. Early voting starts tomorrow, Wednesday.

## Road construction sites

Then we'll talk about traffic.

Many dangerous situations occur on road construction sites due to other traffic.

Many motorists do not slow down at a road construction site, even though the traffic sign says so.

Dangerous situations are also caused by the fact that the motorist uses a mobile phone while driving.

Accidents happen every week at road construction sites due to other traffic.

Over the past three years, 9 people have died and more than 200 have been injured in accidents at road construction sites.

## Cityscape change

Then culture.

Photographs of the changing cityscape and the lives of Finns are of interest to museums.

Here, Pekka Vyhtinen describes the changing landscape in the area of the old Maria hospital in Helsinki.

Vyhtinen belongs to Kuvuussakki, which is a group of volunteer photographers of the Helsinki City Museum.

Volunteers describe the city's changes, life and phenomena to the museums.

Many kinds of pictures that tell about this time have been stored in the Helsinki City Museum.

The pictures show, for example, electric scooters, Alepa block products and electric cabinets.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

There will be showers and thunderstorms in the northern part of the country.

There will also be thunderstorms in the southern part of the country.

The sun is shining in many places.

The temperature is 25-30 degrees. It is cooler in Northern Lapland.
