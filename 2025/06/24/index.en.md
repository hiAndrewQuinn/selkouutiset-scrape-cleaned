## Children's summer camps

Now the topic is children's summer camps.

Children's summer camps are shorter than before.

Many children go away to camp in the summer. At camp, children play sports, swim, and spend time together.

9-year-old Varpu Haapala and Veera Ikola from Seinäjoki are at Kessula summer camp.
