Many Finnish technology companies have big problems. Foreign customers of Finnish companies do not buy enough products. That's why companies make too little profit.

Some technology companies have already said that they are reducing employees. For example, Nokia, Fiskars and Vaisala are cutting employees.

Companies in the machine industry and the metal industry in particular have problems at the moment.

It is bad news for Finland. Machine industry and metal industry companies are important to the Finnish economy.

If the foreign customers of the companies do not soon start buying more Finnish products, unemployment may increase.

SDP is now the most popular party in Finland, according to Yle's new survey. SDP's popularity rose a lot in October.

About 24 percent of Finns now support SDP.

In the parliamentary elections, the Koomum was the largest party, but its popularity has decreased. The Coalition is now the second most popular party.

About 20 percent of Finns now support the coalition.

The popularity of basic Finns did not change much in October. It is the third most popular party.

SDP's support can be increased by the fact that the government intends to weaken unemployment security, for example. SDP has criticized many of the government's plans.

### Attack on websites
