Wide cars. Mini houses. State guest house. Weather.

## Wide cars

First the topic is cars.

The width of the cars has increased.

A wide SUV is parked here.

The width of cars has been increasing for a long time. In 10 years, the width has increased by about 10 centimeters.

Expert James Nix says that in 20 years, SUVs may be as wide as trucks or buses.

The width of the cars is therefore increasing. It brings problems with parking.

In Finland, parking spaces are usually 2.5 meters wide, but that may be too little in the future.

Also, parking along narrow streets may soon be impossible.

There are almost too few parking spaces.

## Mini houses

Then the subject of housing.

Small detached houses are now popular.

This young couple lives in a small detached house, or mini house, in Tuusula. The apartment has 2 bedrooms and a private sauna. The size of the mini house is 50 square meters.

Construction is expensive in Finland. That's why mini houses are popular. The smallest mini houses are only 20 square meters in size.

Small detached houses are now popular.

Many people want a home where the noise of the neighbors does not disturb them and which has its own yard.

**Anna Vesa** does not want to move to an apartment building.

*- I'm not interested at all. Yes, a slightly smaller town like this, a detached house and its own peace and yard, that has been really important to us from the very beginning.*

## State guest house

Then we get to know the slightly bigger apartment.

President Alexander Stubb has moved into the state guest house.

Stubb lives in Valti's guest house, because the president's official residence in MÃ¤ntyniemi is undergoing renovation.

The state guest house is in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki.

The residents of Munkkiniemi are happy to have a new neighbor.

For example, a local merchant sold a lot of really nice cat food. He got the idea from the fact that Stubb also has 2 cats.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be cloudy, meaning it won't rain.

The sun shines in most of the country.

It can also be cloudy on the west coast and in the north.

The temperature is on the plus side in the southern and central parts of the country.

In the north it is zero degrees or slightly below zero.
