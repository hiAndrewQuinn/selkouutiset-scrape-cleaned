Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyi met at Trump's official residence in Washington on Friday. The live televised conversation began peacefully but ended in an argument.

The press conference was canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House early.

Relations between Zelensky and Trump were already bad before the meeting.

Trump has said that Zelenskyi is a dictator and Ukraine is to blame for the war. Zelenskyi has said that Trump lives in the midst of fake news.

Russia invaded Ukraine 3 years ago.

The presidents of Ukraine and the US were supposed to sign an agreement on Ukrainian minerals. Ukraine has a lot of valuable minerals that Trump wants.

The intention was for US companies to become involved in Ukrainian mining operations.

Part of the mining profits was to be invested in a fund to provide money for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war.

However, the agreement was not signed.

Trump got angry with Zelensky and said that Zelensky is not grateful enough to the USA.

The US has been the largest supporter of Ukraine during the war, after Europe.

## Ukraine receives support

Many world and European leaders have given support to the Ukrainian president following the dispute.

Finnish President Alexander Stubb also promised to support Ukraine.

Britain and Ukraine have already signed an agreement, under which Ukraine will receive a loan worth almost 3 billion euros from Britain.

In addition, Britain, France and Ukraine are considering a plan to end the fighting. The plan is to be discussed with the US.

Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo says that Ukraine is a strong part of European defense.
