## Impact of strikes on bus traffic

First, the strike news.

The strikes are also starting to affect bus traffic.

Some bus traffic may stop at the end of the week, at least in the Helsinki region and Jyväskylä.

The reason is that the bus companies are running out of fuel. Some of the bus companies do not get new fuel, because fuel transport does not work normally due to strikes.

The strikes will continue next week, but in Helsinki, for example, the buses will run out of fuel already in the next few days.

Therefore, strikes also affect bus traffic, even if the bus drivers are not on strike.

Helsinki Region Transport, or HSL, announces changes to bus traffic online and in the HSL app.

## Impact of strikes on factories

More strike news.

Many factories stop due to strikes.

The factories' own employees are not on strike, but the factories cannot work because the transports have stopped because of the strikes.

Factories do not receive raw materials, and their products do not go forward to customers.

For example, factories have to be closed in the forest industry and the technology industry.

Many factories stop due to strikes.

Many companies also stop paying wages as soon as the factories stop.

The factory workers think it is not right because they are not on strike themselves.

It can become a big dispute between employees and employers.

## Art event at the Cable Factory

Finally, we go to the Helsinki Cable Factory.

There is a big visual art event at Kaapelitehta.

There are works by more than 700 artists.

That's why it's easy for everyone to get to know Finnish visual art at the event.

The largest visual art event in Finland is organized by the Union of Painters.

The event of the Association of Artists continues until Sunday.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Thursday, it will rain in the south and west, snow in the north. The wind is strong.

The temperature is mainly between 0 and +4 degrees, there is a slight frost in some places in Lapland.
