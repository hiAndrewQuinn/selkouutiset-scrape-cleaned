## Government plans closed child welfare facility

Next news about child protection.

The government is planning a new closed institution for children who commit serious crimes. You can't even leave the institution to go to school.

Currently, for example, Villa Junior is home to children who have committed serious crimes.

Villa Junior director Saana Lehtonen says that children need a new kind of child welfare institution.

– We have a marginal number of children and young people who are difficult to place in any child welfare unit.

– There are also children whose symptoms and behavior are so challenging that we don't have places where they can be treated. At that point, the child is a danger to themselves and their environment.
