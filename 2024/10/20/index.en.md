More babies

There is a lot of talk about the small number of babies in Finland.

Fewer babies are born in Finland than ever before.

It can cause a lot of problems in the future when there are few people of working age.

Professor **Anna Rotkirch's** new report considers how to get more babies to Finland.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## Too few babies

Politicians are trying to get more babies into Finland.

In Finland, women give birth to very few babies these days.

Many women give birth to only one child or none at all.

There are statistics on the number of babies since the 18th century.

Today, fewer babies are born than ever before in statistics.

That is why there will probably be far fewer Finns in the future than now.

## New statement

Politicians are trying to get more babies into Finland.

The board has asked professor Anna Rotkirch for a report proposing solutions to the problem.

The report sparked a lot of discussion and many politicians took a stand on it.

## When is the first child

Why do Finns have so few babies?

Professor Anna Rotkirch says that one big reason is the age of mothers and fathers.

When Finns start having children, they are often over 30 years old.

It means that many have time to have only one child or no child at all.

Many young women do not understand that fertility declines before middle age.

## Money and services

Professor Anna Rotkirch's analysis says that it is good to have the first child at a young age if more babies are wanted.

One way could be that mothers under 30 years of age receive financial support. For example, they can get part of their student loan or mortgage forgiven.

Another important thing is that daycare centers and other services for families with children are in good condition.

More money needs to be put into fertility treatments.

## Repeat

This time the subject was professor Anna Rotkirch's report on babies.

When Finns start having babies, they are often quite old.

The state must give financial support to young mothers, says Rotkirch.

Services for families with children must also be in order.

This was Uutisviikko in clear Finnish. See you again. Goodbye!
