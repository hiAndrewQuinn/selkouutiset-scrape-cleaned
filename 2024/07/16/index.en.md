Republican caucus. Digital scams. Alien species. Weather.

## Trump presidential candidate

First news from the USA.

Donald Trump is the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.

The issue was decided at the Republican party meeting.

Trump's running mate is Senator J.D. Vance.

At the meeting, Trump wore a bandage over his ear because he was shot over the weekend. Otherwise, former President Trump was in good shape.

Donald Trump is therefore the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.

The US presidential election is in November.

## Digital scams

Then the topic is digital scams.

Digital scams are common these days.

In digital scams, criminals steal money or information via the Internet, for example.

Up to 70 percent of Finns say that they have at least been tried to cheat digitally.

Many people think that digital scams are mostly done to the elderly. However, young people are often the victims. Criminals can take their password or credit card number, for example.

*Young people may shop online a lot. We know that especially credit card numbers and other card numbers are fished for, for example, in the name of fake online stores or online flea scams.*

Digital scams are common these days.

People can be offered, for example, the opportunity to invest money in a good object. In reality, the money disappears into the pockets of criminals.

## Alien species

Then news about nature and alien species.

In Finland, work is being done against alien species.

This is where we are eradicating kurtus rose from the Ostrobothnia archipelago. The gray rose is one of the guest species.

Alien species come from abroad, and they take up space from Finland's natural plants.

Many alien species spread so effectively that other plants cannot grow.

That's why we want to eradicate alien species.

Harmful alien species must also not be bought or brought to Finland, so that they do not spread.

For example, the black rose has spread from yards to nature because birds eat its berries.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Wednesday, the weather will vary.

It can rain in Lapland. It rains and thunders in the south.

Elsewhere it's raining and the sun is shining.

The temperature is above 20 degrees throughout the country.
