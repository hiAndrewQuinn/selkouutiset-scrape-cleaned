Orders from NATO countries. Conscription. Electric scooters. Weather.

## Orders from NATO countries

First the economic news.

Finland's NATO membership has brought more jobs to Finnish companies.

Finland became a member of NATO last year.

This company in Salo manufactures boats for surveillance tasks and military use.

Now the boat for the Danish Navy has been completed.

The company is also negotiating new orders with many other NATO countries.

Finland's NATO membership has brought more jobs to Finnish companies.

The company from Salo has already hired 20 new employees this year and needs even more employees.

That is why the company cooperates with vocational schools.

## Invitations

Then the topic is the army.

Illness can prevent entry into the army.

In Finland, men are forced to join the army or civil service, which replaces service in the army.

Here, a group of 18-year-old men are on invitations. In the invitations, they get information about the army.

However, not everyone can join the army.

Some diseases, for example diabetes, prevent entry into the army.

Other illnesses can affect service. This is how **Juuso Salmi**:

*Yes, I have always known that I have ADHD medication myself, so I know that it affects at least that service.*

Salmi will be able to call again after 1 or 2 years. Salmi hopes that then she will find a job that suits her.

## Electric scooters

Then the topic is an electric scooter.

Electric scooter accidents have decreased in Helsinki.

This is what doctor Henri Vasara's research says.

Accidents have decreased because the speed of electric scooters has been limited.

In addition, the use of electric scooters at night is restricted in Helsinki.

Electric scooter accidents have decreased in Helsinki.

Accidents may decrease even more if the government's proposal is implemented.

The government proposes that you may not use an electric scooter if you have consumed alcohol.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow the whole country will be cloudy, that is, it won't rain. The sun is shining, but sometimes it can also be cloudy.

The temperature is a little over ten degrees in the south and around five degrees in the north.
