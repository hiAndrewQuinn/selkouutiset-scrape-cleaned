Freedom of the press. Finnair cancels flights. Norppalive. Weather.

## Freedom of the press

First, a matter about freedom of the press.

Finland ranks 5th in the measurement, which examines press freedom in different parts of the world.

The measurement is published annually by the organization Reporters Without Borders.

The measurement assesses, for example, media independence and pluralism, journalist safety and self-censorship.

Press freedom is strongest in Norway, Estonia, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Finland is 5th for the fourth year in a row.

Press freedom is weakest in China and North Korea.

## Finnair canceled flights

Then the topic was the work stoppage at the airport.

Finnair has canceled flights from today due to industrial action.

Finnair has canceled approximately 140 flights. The cancellations affect approximately 12,000 passengers.

The reason for the flight cancellations is the industrial action by the Finnish Aviation Union. For example, there have been four-hour work stoppages in aircraft maintenance and catering.

The IAU is also organizing work stoppages on Monday. The aim of the industrial action is to accelerate negotiations on a new collective agreement.

## Ringed seal live

One more thing about wildlife cameras.

The environmental organization WWF's wildlife camera Norppalive will be launched today.

In Norppalive, the camera captures a shore rock on the shore of Lake Saimaa. This rock is where ringed seals often come to rest.

This is the 10th year that the camera has been following the Saimaa ringed seal. Ringed seal live has been viewed 11 million times so far.

The nature camera is currently also monitoring the nesting of the osprey, a large bird of prey.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

There will be snow and rain in the north.

There will be showers in many places in the southern and central parts of the country. It will be breezy at times.

The temperature is between 0 and +10 degrees. There is a slight frost in places in Northern Lapland.
