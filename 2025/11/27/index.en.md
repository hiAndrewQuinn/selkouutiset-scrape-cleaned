Finnish education. Working life skills. Schools. Weather.

## Finnish education

The first topic is Finnish language teaching.

Trade unions want more Finnish language instruction for immigrants who come to Finland for work. It is difficult for immigrants to get jobs if their language skills are poor.

**Vanessa Phekani** moved to Finland from Malawi, Africa. She has lived in Oulu for 7 years. Phekani has not been able to find work in Finland, even though she has a good education and a lot of work experience:

-I'm looking for different jobs. It's difficult because I don't speak Finnish well.

## Working life skills

Next we go to the children's kindergarten.

In Tampere daycare centers, children are taught working life skills. Young children learn, for example, how to cooperate. The study of working life skills continues later in school.

Children from Metsäniityn kindergarten in Tampere share their thoughts about the work. **Leo Niininen**, **Nooa Reiman**, **Venni Sadeharju** and **Aleksi Urhonen:**

-Work, whatever needs to be done. That's all that needs to be done.

-Firefighters put out fires. That's work too.

-Sausage factory.

-The work is pretty funny for kids and teenagers.

Tampere daycare centers teach children working life skills. The goal is to make it easier for young people to transition from school to working life later.

## Schools

Now news about school buildings.

More schools are being demolished in Finland than before. Over 100 schools are demolished in Finland every year. Many school buildings have mold. There are not enough students in the schools. There are currently about 2,000 comprehensive schools in Finland.

More schools are being demolished in Finland than before. Experts say that many school buildings will also be demolished in the coming years.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow, Friday, it will rain in the south and east. It will snow in the north. The temperature will rise to the plus side, except in Lapland.
