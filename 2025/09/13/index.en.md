## Declining birth rate in Finland

The topic of the news week is the decline in the birth rate in Finland.

Fewer children are being born in Finland now than ever before.

It is difficult for municipalities to organize services when the number of children decreases.

For example, the number of schools may decrease significantly. We will now talk more about the decline in the birth rate and its effects.

## Birth rate

The fertility rate in Finland is now 1.25. This means that one woman has an average of 1.25 children.

The birth rate was almost 1.8 for a long time, but it has dropped to 1.25.

The birth rate has been declining for a long time. However, during the last 12 months, the birth rate has increased slightly again.

## Schools

The decline in the birth rate is reflected in schools. There are fewer students than before.

Municipalities need to think about how they will be able to organize schools and other services when the birth rate is declining.

The number of schools is decreasing because the number of children is decreasing.

Many children's journeys to school will become longer as the number of schools decreases. More money will be spent on school transportation.

Researchers say the number of schools could decrease by up to 50 percent.

Uusimaa is the only province where the number of schoolchildren is not decreasing.

In Uusimaa, the number of children with an immigrant background is increasing in schools because the number of children with an ethnic Finnish background is not increasing.
