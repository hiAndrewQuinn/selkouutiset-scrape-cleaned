Finnish Christmas dishes

## Finnish Christmas food tradition

This time, the topic of the news week is Finnish Christmas dishes.

The Finnish Christmas food tradition is quite young. Back in the 19th century, there were no special Christmas dishes in Finland. People ate better at Christmas than on weekdays, but different homes ate many different dishes.

The current Christmas food tradition originated in the 20th century.

We will now tell you about the most popular Finnish Christmas dishes.

## Ham and boxes

The most popular Christmas dish is ham. The ham is slowly baked. The surface of the ham is decorated with mustard, breadcrumbs and cloves. On a plate, mustard is spread over the ham slices.

About 70 percent of Finns want to eat ham at Christmas. About 6 million kilos of ham are sold at Christmas.

A box of semolina is eaten with the ham. It is made from semolina, spices and syrup and baked in the oven.

Other boxes on the Christmas table include a carrot box and a potato box.

## Cold fish dishes

Christmas meals usually start with cold fish dishes.

The most popular cold fish dish is salmon in gravy. The salmon fillet is seasoned with salt, sugar and dill and left to mature in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days.

The salmon is then cut into thin slices. Whitefish is also a popular fish for gravy.

Other cold Christmas fish dishes include herring and herring in a spiced broth.

Cold-smoked salmon and hot-smoked salmon are also popular Christmas fish dishes.

## Rosolli

The Christmas table salad is rosolli. Rosolli contains boiled potatoes, beetroot, carrots, apples and onions.

## Rice porridge

Rice porridge is also eaten at Christmas. It is eaten, for example, in the morning or during the day.

Rice porridge became more common at the end of the 19th century, when rice began to be imported to Finland by train.

Rice porridge is sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Some people like to eat rice porridge with plum soup, for example.

An almond is put in the rice porridge. An old belief is that an almond brings good luck to the one who receives it.

## Mulled wine

The Christmas drink is mulled wine. It is a spiced juice or wine that is heated.

Mulled wine came to Finland from Sweden. Hot mulled wine warms you up after a day outdoors, for example.
