## Cold

First, the subject of frost.

The severe cold continues in Finland. It's even over 30 degrees below zero.

The frost hinders construction work. For example, such concrete work will not be successful if there is a lot of frost. The frost hardens the concrete.

This construction site in Jyväskylä has now stopped. Juha Koivisto, the foreman in charge, says that the concrete work is already stopped when it is above 15 degrees below zero. No work is done in temperatures above 25 degrees below zero.

The severe cold continues.

Because of the frost, many trains have been late. VR says that the cold weather hinders the trains' compressed air system. That's why, for example, train doors don't always work.

## Pharmacies

Then news about pharmacies.

Pharmacies are ready to handle health services as well.

There are already 30 pharmacies in Finland with health points.

This health center is in a pharmacy in Turku.

At the health center, a nurse administers vaccinations and blood tests, for example.

Pharmacies are ready to handle health services as well.

In addition, Finland is considering whether a health center can provide some services in a pharmacy.

Sometimes a pharmacy is closer to people than a health center.

In addition, the authorities are preparing for pharmacists in pharmacies to be allowed to administer vaccinations.

## Street lights

Then the topic is street lights.

New street lamps save energy and money.

For example, in Pietarsaari, old lamps are replaced with new LED lamps.

An old lamp consumes energy for 60 euros a year, an LED lamp for only 10 euros.

The new technology also allows you to adjust the lights. Lights are used at full power only when necessary.

New street lamps bring savings.

When Pietarsaari has replaced the last 2,000 old lamps with new ones, the city will get additional savings of 100,000 euros per year.

## Weather

Another weather forecast. The weather continues to be very cold.

In the southern part of the country, the temperature is between -15 and -25 degrees.

It is colder in the central and northern part of the country, the temperature is -30 degrees on both sides.

The weather is cloudy and sunny in many places.
