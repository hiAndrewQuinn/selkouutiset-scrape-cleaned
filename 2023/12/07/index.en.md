The workers' organization SAK is planning strikes. If strikes are organized, they will start on Thursday of next week and always last for one day.

SAK plans to organize strikes if the government weakens the position of workers. The government is planning, for example, that in the future the employee will no longer receive salary from the first day of sick leave.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo does not like SAK's strike plans. Orpo says that the rules of working life must be reformed.

In Helsinki, 2 demonstrations were organized at Töölöntor on Independence Day. Now we are discussing the actions of the police against the demonstrators.

The police arrested more than 50 protesters at Töölöntor. The demonstrators think that the police used too much force when they took the demonstrators away from Töölöntor.

The police cleared Töölöntor so that the participants of the different demonstrations do not start arguing with each other.

The celebrations of the Independence Day Castle attracted people this year as well. More than 3 million people watched Linna's party on TV.

There were 1,700 guests at the castle's party this year. TV viewers could watch how the presidential couple shook hands with the guests.

President Sauli Niinistö and Jenni Haukio have already organized the Independence Day Castle celebrations many times, the first time in 2012.

This year, Niinistö was the host of Linna's party for the last time, because next year a new president will be elected in Finland.

In an interview with Yle, Sauli Niinistö and Jenni Haukio told that the Linna party has been important to them. They are happy that they have been able to organize Linna's party.
