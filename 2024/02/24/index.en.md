Sauli Väinämö Niinistö has been the president of Finland for 2 terms, i.e. 12 years.

Niinistö had a long career in politics, even before he became president.

He was, for example, a member of parliament, chairman of the coalition, minister of finance, minister of justice and speaker of the parliament.

When Sauli Niinistö started as president, he had little experience in foreign policy. He had never done the job of foreign minister or prime minister.

As president, Niinistö has emphasized the power of the president in managing foreign policy and wanted to lead foreign policy.

He also had good relations with the presidents of the USA and Russia. Relations with Russia are now broken because of the war of aggression.
