The environmental organization WWF's nature camera Norppalive was opened on Friday. The camera captures footage of a shore rock where Saimaa ringed seals often come to rest.

The Saimaa ringed seal is a seal that lives only in Finland. The Saimaa ringed seal lives in Eastern Finland on Lake Saimaa, which is Finland's largest lake.

The Saimaa ringed seal became isolated in Lake Saimaa around 8,000 years ago. After the Ice Age, the connection between Lake Saimaa and the Baltic Sea was severed because the land began to rise.

## Pullervo and Nuppu

WWF opened Norppalive for the first time in 2016. Norppalive has been viewed over 11 million times so far.

Viewers have been able to vote for the name of the ringed seal they recognize from the pictures. There were over 5,000 suggestions, and Pullervo received the most votes.

Pullervo has since been seen live every spring except 2020.

The newest star of the ringed seal life is the Saimaa seal Nuppu.

## Sääksilive

The nature camera is also currently monitoring midge nesting.

The osprey is a large bird of prey, also known as the osprey. In spring, ospreys often return to Finland to the same nest in the top of a tree.

Weather uses dry branches and twigs for construction.

The nest can become large over the years, so it needs a strong tree underneath.

## Other animals - and a cash register

Nature cameras, or nature live cameras, have been around in Finland for many years.

The natural waters have included, for example, many birds, a cow, a puppy, a sheep, trout and other fish, a viper, a beaver and various furry creatures.

Finns also like live cams in strange ways.

For example, the Prisma and Sub-channel chain Hihna247 was a hit on social media and television in 2017.

The 8-hour live online TV broadcast filmed the supermarket checkout line.

Later, cashiers were shown live on Midsummer's Eve.

The concrete drying process was also monitored in the live broadcast.

The topic of the week was wildlife cameras. The wildlife camera Norppalive was opened on Friday. The säkkilive has also been launched.
