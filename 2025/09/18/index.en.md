## Economic growth

First, economic news.

Forecasts for economic growth have declined.

In the spring, many researchers predicted that the Finnish economy would grow by more than 1 percent this year.

New forecasts show that the Finnish economy will grow by less than 1 percent.

The economy is growing slowly because people don't want to spend a lot of money.

For example, they don't buy many goods and services.

This is what **Päivi Puonti**, Head of Forecasting at the Research Institute of Finnish Economy, says.

*Mainly, household consumption has been weaker than it looked before.*

The reason is concern about the situation in the world and about ourselves. When people save, the economy does not grow.

## Wastewater treatment plant

Now for some technology news.

This is Tampere's new wastewater treatment plant.

Its use has started this week.

The treatment plant is large. It covers an area of 5 hectares.

The treatment plant cost hundreds of millions of euros.

The new treatment plant features cutting-edge technology.

In aeration tanks, air is pumped into the wastewater. The tank contains microbes that break down the impurities in the wastewater. This is biological purification.

The treatment plant will also include UV disinfection.

A new wastewater treatment plant has been put into operation in Tampere.

The staff at the treatment plant say that the quality of bathing water in Tampere is improving because the treatment plant is very efficient. The wastewater from 5 municipalities will soon be discharged there.

## Teacher Now play

Finally, cultural news.

This is where we are rehearsing for Q Theatre's new play.

The main role is played by actress **Elina Knihtilä**.

The play is called *Teacher Now*.

It tells about power relations and the gap between young and old.

The venue is an art school.

The play takes place in two times, in the teacher's youth and in the present.

The play depicts the conflict between different eras, which is difficult for a teacher.

The play Teacher Now will be performed at Q Theatre in Helsinki. The next night is today, Thursday.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Friday, the sun will shine almost throughout the country.

Only in the far east and south does it rain occasionally.

The temperature is between 14...18 degrees, in Lapland between 6...12 degrees.
