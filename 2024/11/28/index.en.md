Flood control. Finlandia Award. Turku's Christmas tree. Friday's weather.

## Flood control

First the topic is floods.

Attempts are being made to prevent flooding.

Municipalities are working to reduce flood damage in the future. Flood damage can cost municipalities a lot.

For example, pipe bridges have already been built in Riihimäki. Now Vantaanjoki water can flow under the roads. Water no longer floods the center of Riihimäki.

The state supports the municipalities and gives them 2-3 million euros per year to prevent floods.

So they are trying to prevent floods.

The last few days have seen how important work is.

In many cities, flood water rose on the streets and roads when the snow melted and at the same time it rained a lot.

Many roads were closed due to the flood, and the floods also disrupted train traffic.

## Finlandia Award

Then the subject of the award.

**Pajtim Statovci** has won the Finlandia prize for literature.

The Finlandia Award is Finland's most important literary award.

Statovci won the prize with a book called The cow gives birth at night.

In the book, Statovci deals with difficult emotions: anger, shame, terror.

An important place in the book is Kosovo.

Pajtim Statovci has won the Finlandia prize for literature.

Statovci was born in Kosovo. The family fled the war to Finland when Statovci was 2 years old.

In all of Statovci's books, Kosovo plays an important role.

Statovci is now 34 years old. He won the Finlandia prize already for the second time.

The last time Statovci won the Finlandia prize was 5 years ago.

## Turku Christmas tree

Then the topic is the Christmas tree.

Finland's most famous Christmas tree is in Turku every year. It stands in front of Turku Cathedral.

This year's Christmas tree was delivered yesterday. It is 22 meters high and weighs 6,000 kilograms.

The Christmas tree lights are lit on Saturday. They bring joy to people throughout the Christmas season.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be cloudy and mild in the southern and central part of the country.

It's freezing in Lapland and the wind is strong. The sky is clear, meaning there are no clouds in the sky.

It is snowing a little in the Northeast.
