The use of snowpack is becoming more common.

Over 20 ski trails built from last winter's snow, or snowpack, will open in Finland this autumn. Trails have already opened this month in places such as Imatra, Kajaani and Vihti.

Ski slopes have also already been opened using stored snow.

Snowpack is used primarily by tourism companies. Many municipalities also use snowpack to build a first snow slope for their residents.

## Last winter's snow

Stored snow is snow that has been collected the previous winter.

The snow is made into large piles, on top of which accordion mats and protective blankets are placed for insulation. The snow remains under the insulating mats throughout the summer.

Snowpack is of particular interest to the tourism industry. Due to climate change, the start of winter and the arrival of snow are uncertain. Snowpack helps to get the winter tourism season started, even if the arrival of snow is delayed.

Snow storage at Levi Ski Resort began 10 years ago. This year, almost 300,000 cubic meters of snow were stored.

Many Central European countries and, for example, Norway have visited Levi's snow piles and used them as a model for snow storage.

Finnish company Snow Secure has developed a technology for storing snow, and it is also used in Levi. The technology is also exported to various parts of the world, for example to Italy, Switzerland, the USA and Canada.

This year, the American Time magazine selected Snow Secure's insulated mat as one of the best inventions of the year.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week this time was snow storage. Let's recap a bit.

The use of snowpack is growing in Finland and around the world.

Snow storage is snow from last winter. The snow has been made into a large pile and is stored under insulation mats over the summer.

With the help of stored snow, the winter tourist season can begin, even if the arrival of snow is delayed.

That's all for now, see you again next week.
