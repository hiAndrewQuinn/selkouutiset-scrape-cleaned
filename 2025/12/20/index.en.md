## Miss Finland

The series of events began when Miss Finland **Sarah Dzafce** stretched her eyes with her fingers so that she looked Chinese.

A picture of Dzafce went viral on social media last week. The caption included the word "Chinese".

The picture may have been a joke, but it had serious consequences.

Many people felt that the image was offensive to Asian people and that the image was therefore racist.

That's why Dzafce lost the Miss Finland crown, meaning she is no longer Miss Finland.

## Members of Parliament

After this, Finns Party MPs **Kaisa Garedew** and **Juho Eerola** published pictures in which they stretched their eyes in the same way.

They said they wanted to support Miss Finland.

Asian newspapers and social media users strongly criticized the Finns' behavior.

Finland received a lot of negative attention, especially in China, South Korea and Japan.

The Finnish airline Finnair also received a lot of negative feedback from Asia.

## Apologies

This week, Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** apologized for the use of MPs through the embassies of Japan, South Korea, and China.

Orpo said that racist behavior is not accepted in Finland.

The Finns Party parliamentary group gave Garedew and Eerola a serious warning on Thursday.

The Finns Party group said that such images should not be published.

Garedew and Eerola also apologized.

## Government disagreements

There has been disagreement in the government and parliament about how serious the matter was.

The chairman of the Finns Party, **Riikka Purra**, said that the pictures were a bad idea, but he did not call the pictures racist.

Purra said that the purpose of the MPs' images was not racist.

The Prime Minister's National Coalition Party and many other parties said the images were racist and condemned them.
