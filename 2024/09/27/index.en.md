House of Parliament. Hydrogen station. Gold diggers. Saturday's weather.

## Parliament building

First, the topic is the House of Parliament.

In Finland, there is talk of knocking down the Parliament.

The parliament building was vandalized on Wednesday. Its pillars were sprayed with red liquid.

The case is being talked about a lot because the Parliament House is important to Finns. It is a symbol of democracy.

Finns have seen demonstrations in front of the Parliament.

But now, for the first time since the war, traces were left in the House of Parliament. It shocked many.

There is a lot of talk about knocking down the parliament building.

The vandals are Swedish and Finnish demonstrators.

They are protesting against the fact that a Finnish company produces peat in Sweden.

Peat production is harmful to the climate and therefore it must be stopped, the protesters say.

## Hydrogen station

Then the topic is the hydrogen station.

A large hydrogen station is planned to be built in Jyväskylä.

Hydrogen buses fill up at the hydrogen station first. There are hardly any other hydrogen cars in Finland yet.

Finland's first hydrogen buses are coming to Jyväskylä. By next summer, the city will have 5 hydrogen buses.

Jyväskylä wants to reduce traffic emissions. A hydrogen car is a better option for the climate than a petrol car.

The hydrogen station in Jyväskylä will be completed next summer.

## Gold diggers

Then the topic is honey.

You can find gold in Finland.

The best chance to find gold is in Lapland. Gold diggers even come to Lapland from abroad.

These men have come from Sweden. They dig for gold in Inari, Finnish Lapland.

The work is hard, but it is a men's hobby.

André Christensen's dream is to find enough gold to make jewelry for a loved one.

When Christensen pans for gold, he finds little gold nuggets.

I'm sure I'll find more one day, Christensen says and laughs.

So you can find gold in Finland.

First, however, the gold digger has to take care of the permit matters.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

It rains in the southern part of the country. There will also be rain in Eastern Lapland.

Elsewhere it's cloudy, sunny in some places. The weather is getting colder.

The temperature is between 5 and 13 degrees throughout the country, it is cooler in Northern Lapland.
