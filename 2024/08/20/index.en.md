## Internet use by young people

First, the topic is young people and the Internet.

Excessive internet use by young people has increased. This is what a study by the Institute of Health and Welfare says.

Excessive internet use means that the internet takes up a lot of time and causes problems for the user. However, it is difficult for the user to reduce internet usage.

In particular, the excessive use of the Internet by girls has increased. Internet use has grown the most among high school girls. Boys' internet use has not grown as much as girls'.

Excessive internet use by young people is increasing. It causes many problems.

A young person can use the Internet so much that it hinders, for example, learning and remembering. Excessive internet use also causes mental health problems.

## Corona vaccinations

Then the news about corona vaccinations.

Corona vaccinations will be given earlier this fall than before.

The Department of Health and Welfare recommends that residents of nursing homes, clients of home care and people over 80 years of age be vaccinated first.

Many welfare areas have already started corona vaccinations. Some will start corona vaccinations this week.

Corona vaccinations will therefore be given earlier this fall than before.

Corona vaccinations are started with the oldest and weakest. Other risk groups can be vaccinated later in the fall.

## Nursing home for animals

Finally, we visit an animal nursing home.

The name of this farm is Wanha Markki.

There are more than 100 animals on the farm. Chickens, pigs, sheep and other animals run here. They are old, they are no longer useful in agriculture.

The owner of the farm, Heikki Laaksonen, presents a horse named Mestari.

The champion is an old racehorse. It is no longer valuable, but it can spend its retirement days in Old Mark. Here, all animals are precious.

Animals that have been mistreated are also brought to the farm.

## Wednesday's weather

Tomorrow the weather will be cloudy almost all over the country.

A new weather front is approaching Finland and the wind is getting stronger.

The day is warm. The temperature is above 20 degrees.

It may start to rain in the evening.
