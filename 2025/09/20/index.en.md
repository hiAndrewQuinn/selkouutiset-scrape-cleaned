Yle news in plain Finnish reported on Friday about the insecurity of cities. Vantaa is currently the most unsafe city in Finland. We will now tell you more about the cities.

## The most unsafe cities in Finland

Yle has received new statistics from the police on the security situation in Finland's 10 largest cities.

The police disturbance index shows the level of insecurity.

The index includes, for example, homicides recorded in public places.

The index also includes assaults, sexual crimes, vandalism and attempts at these.

## Changes in Vantaa, Jyväskylä and Tampere

Vantaa is currently the most unsafe city in Finland.

The police say that there are many acts of violence in Vantaa.

For example, Vantaa has a lot of young people and unemployed people, which affects the number of crimes.

Violence is often associated with criminal showdowns and, for example, drug trafficking.

However, the police remind people to be brave and move around the streets of Vantaa.

## Jyväskylä is the second most unsafe city

The second most unsafe place in Finland is Jyväskylä. The disturbance index has been raised this year by many attempted murders and homicides.

However, police say that these crimes did not occur in the downtown area.

Jyväskylä is experimenting with security guards on the streets of the city center. The experiment will last a year, and it is already showing good results.

## Tampere is in 3rd place

The police say they have increased surveillance in Kuopio and solved crimes effectively.
