## Unnecessary health care tests

Finally, some news about healthcare.

Unnecessary tests and medications are prescribed in healthcare.

This is what a new study says.

Many doctors prescribe antibiotics or X-rays, for example, because otherwise the patient may be dissatisfied with the doctor.

Up to 30 percent of examinations or treatments are unnecessary, meaning they do not benefit the patient or are of little benefit.

Unnecessary tests and medications are prescribed in healthcare.

Unnecessary treatments cost hundreds of millions of euros a year.

Researcher **Aleksi Raudasoja** says that savings and better care are achieved when the doctor discusses with the patient whether treatment is really needed.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, the sun will shine almost throughout the country.

It's really cold in Lapland, and it's freezing elsewhere too.

It will be cloudy in the south, and there may be some snow in the southeast.
