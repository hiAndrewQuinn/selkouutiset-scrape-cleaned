Labor market survey. Orange juice. Ski holiday. Weather.

## Labor market survey

First, we will tell you what Finns think about the government's intentions to reform the labor market and social security.

Changing the first sick day to unpaid is the most difficult issue for Finns in the government's reforms.

Taloustutkimus asked Finns which of the government's reform intentions are the most difficult to accept.

34 percent said that it is difficult to accept being unpaid for the first day of sick leave.

Almost as many found it most difficult that the child allowance and the so-called 300-euro protection component are removed from unemployment insurance.

The easiest thing for Finns is to accept the expansion of local bargaining and the fact that compensation fines for illegal strikes are increased.

## Orange juice

Then the news about the price of orange juice.

Orange juice has become more expensive during the year.

Its price has risen by several tens of percent.

The price increase is due to the fact that the orange harvests in South America have been bad. The harvest has been weakened by, for example, bad weather and plant diseases, says Janne Vuorinen, director of purchasing and sales of groceries at Kesko.

When orange juice has become more expensive, customers have switched to cheaper juice.

K-trader Petri Miettinen says that, for example, sales of apple juice have increased.

## Ski holidays

Now about the price of a ski holiday.

The ski resorts in the north are busy now that the winter holiday season has started.

The season raises the prices of accommodation and services. A holiday week in Lapland can cost thousands of euros.

Kati Rantala, Yle, Levi:

\- Can you roughly estimate how much it will cost in total?

Kati and Noora Heikkil√§, Helsinki:

\- Probably a couple of tons.

\- More than a couple of tons, probably. Accommodation, lift tickets have become more expensive, Equipment rental was perhaps not so much more expensive. And then, of course, meals.

Andre Silfver, Raasepori:

\- Yes, we had a certain budget, but it always goes over, of course, when you're busy here. Yes, at least it takes tons.

## Wednesday's weather

Weak snowfall is falling in the north.

It can also snow very little in places further south. Cloudiness is abundant throughout the country.

A new area of snow will arrive from the west by Wednesday evening.

The temperature is between +1 and -12 degrees throughout the country.
