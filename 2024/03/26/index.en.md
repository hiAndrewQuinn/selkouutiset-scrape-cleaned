Effects of strikes. Metal recycling. Ski resorts. Weather.

## Effects of strikes

First, news about the effects of the strikes.

In Finland, more factories stop due to strikes.

The factories cannot work because the transports are interrupted at the ports. Factories do not receive parts and raw materials, and their products do not go out into the world.

For example, Valmet Automotive's car factory in Uusikaupunki has stopped. That's why the more than 700 employees of the factory will also stop receiving salary payments.

Metsä Group's cardboard factory in Äänekoski has also stopped. However, the factory's employees get paid because they now do, for example, maintenance work.

Factories have therefore stopped due to strikes.

The factories' own employees are not on strike, but political strikes in ports, for example, hinder the factories' operations.

Political strikes are a protest by trade unions to a government that intends to change the rules of working life.

## Metal recycling

Then the topic is metal recycling.

Metal recycling is a profitable activity.

Recycled metal is sold to car factories, for example.

This recycling facility near Tammisaari uses the latest technology.

Production manager Ralf Björklund says that the metal waste is first crushed.

Then the metal is separated using, for example, a magnet and a laser.

In this way, the customer receives metals that are ready for use.

Metal recycling is a profitable activity.

This recycling facility sells everything it produces in advance.

## Ski resorts

Then the matter of ski resorts.

Ski center prices have risen.

3-day lift tickets already cost several hundred euros in large ski resorts.

However, prices are much cheaper in small ski resorts.

It's a busy time at the ski resorts at the end of this week, because many Finns spend the Easter holiday on the slopes.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

There will be scattered sleet or snow showers in the western part of the country.

In Eastern Lapland and in the southwest, the sun gets to shine a little.

In the southern part of the country, the temperature rises above +5 degrees in some places. Otherwise, the temperature is between -4 and +4 degrees.
