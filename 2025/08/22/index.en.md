Student loans. Bank scams. Bears. Weather.

## Student loans

Initially, the topic is student finances.

Students are taking out more and more student loans.

The average loan taken out during the study period is already over 12,000 euros. The amount of the loan has more than doubled in 10 years.

Student grants have been changed so that many students have to take out loans.

For example, housing support has decreased for many students, but more student loans can be obtained than before.

## Bank scams

Then the topic of bank fraud.

There are more and more attempts to scam people out of their bank details.

Criminals manage to defraud over 100 million euros annually, according to the Finnish Ministry of Finance.

Around 500 cases are reported to the police every month in which people have been tricked into giving their bank details to a criminal.

The number of bank account frauds has increased rapidly.

S-pankki says that fraud will not be compensated if the customer has been careless with the access codes and handed them over to a criminal.

## Bears

Then we'll talk about bears.

Forestry workers are trained to encounter bears.

Education is necessary because the bear population in Finland has grown. The Natural Resources Institute Finland says that there may now be over 2,300 bears in Finnish forests.

Forestry workers are trained to encounter bears.

Kai-Erik Nyholm, an expert at the Finnish Game Centre, says that bears usually avoid humans. That's why it's a good idea to keep quiet when moving around in the forest.

However, if the bear comes towards you and seems angry, do this:

"- Throw yourself on the ground and protect your neck and head with your hands," Nyholm advises.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather on Saturday will be changeable and cool.

It's raining in Lapland. It can rain a little in other parts of the country too. However, it's also breezy during the day.

The temperature is around 8-17 degrees.
