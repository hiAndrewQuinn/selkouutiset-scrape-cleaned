Reversal law. Internships at universities of applied sciences. Jumping off a bridge. Weather.

## Reversal law

First, news about the conversion law.

Parliament will vote on the conversion law on Friday. The plenary session of the Parliament discussed the bill for more than 7 hours yesterday.

The law is an exceptional law, so support from the opposition parties is also needed for its approval.

The center and SDP support the law, but a few SDP MPs plan to vote against it. The Greens and the Left Alliance oppose the law.

The conversion law will be voted on on Friday.

With the help of the law, Finland can turn away asylum seekers at the eastern border.

## Internship

Then the matter of students' work placements.

There are not enough internships for university of applied sciences students.

For example, about 10 percent of nursing students cannot find an internship. It's a big problem, because many things are learned during the internship.

In the social and health sector, work training can be up to 80 weeks, or half of the studies.

There are not enough internships for university of applied sciences students.

There is also a shortage of internships in, for example, the construction industry.

## Jumping off a bridge

Finally, we go to see the youth's summer hobby, which the police think is dangerous.

Young people jump from cliffs and bridges into the water.

Jumping is especially popular among teenage boys and young men. The most dizzy jump really high.

These young people dive into the water from Lukkarinsilla in Pori.

The police remind us that jumping from bridges can be dangerous. For example, sunken logs or scrap can move under the water. Strong currents can also surprise even a good swimmer.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Thursday, the weather will vary in Finland.

It is raining in the west and Lapland. In rainy areas, the temperature is below 20 degrees.

In the east there is rain and heat. The temperature can be up to 28 degrees in the east.
