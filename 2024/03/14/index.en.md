## Number of school children

First the school news.

The number of school children is decreasing in Finland.

There will soon be so few schoolchildren that municipalities will have to close schools. Not all schools have enough students.

The Confederation of Municipalities estimates that in 2030 there will be 80,000 fewer elementary school students in Finland than now.

The number of school children is decreasing because too few children are born.

The number of school children is decreasing.

Immigration improves the situation, however, because the number of schoolchildren who speak foreign languages increases.

For example, in the Helsinki region, around 30 percent of school children will speak a foreign language in 2030.

## Church and marriage

Then news from the Lutheran Church of Finland.

The church may soon accept different types of marriages.

The leaders of the Lutheran Church, i.e. the bishops, want to end the argument about whether the church can also ordain female and male couples.

The bishops propose that the church ordain all couples. However, each priest can decide for himself whether he ordains male and female couples.

If the bishops' proposal goes through in the synod, it means that the church also accepts gay unions.

Until now, the official opinion of the church has been that marriage can only be concluded between a woman and a man.

However, many priests have already married male and female couples. That's why we're arguing about it.

The church may soon accept different types of marriages.

Finnish law does not distinguish between different couples. The civil ceremony is the same for all couples.

## Strikes and traffic

Finally, information about strikes and traffic.

The political strikes have stopped fuel transportation.

Gasoline dealers say that there is enough fuel at the gas stations. However, the price of gasoline may rise.

Bus traffic has managed with the help of warehouses. Next week, the fuel may start to run out, and there may be changes to the bus service.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast. It is cloudy in the south and there may be drizzle. The sun shines in places in the middle of the earth. There will be light snow showers in Lapland. The temperature is mainly between -2 and +6 degrees, it is colder in Northern Lapland.
