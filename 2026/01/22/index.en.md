Trump tariffs. Memory patients. Plant winter. Weather forecast.

## Trump's tariff threats

First, news about international security policy.

The US has withdrawn its threat of tariffs on Finland and other European countries.

The US threatened Finland and 7 other countries with tariffs because the countries support Denmark and Greenland.

The countries do not want the US to buy or occupy Greenland.

On Wednesday evening, US President **Donald Trump** announced that the tariffs would be lifted.

Trump says he had a good conversation with the NATO Secretary General.

Europe and the USA may work together to improve Greenland's security.

The US has withdrawn its threat of tariffs on Finland and other European countries.

EU leaders are starting an important meeting in Switzerland today.

## Disappearances of people with memory problems

Now, news about people with memory problems.

The disappearances of people with dementia are increasing in Finland. This is what experts say.

There have been several cases in Finland this winter where people with dementia have left home and even died because it is cold outside.

For example, a person with dementia may go out in the freezing cold in a nightgown.

Police and researchers estimate that the disappearances of people with dementia are increasing in Finland.

This happens because many elderly people do not receive enough help.

This is what researcher **Jari Pirhonen** from the University of Tampere says.

*"They will definitely increase. I am sure that the police will have more and more search tasks where they are looking for people with memory problems."*

Researcher Pirhonen is concerned about the state of elderly care. He says that services for the elderly need to be improved.

## Winter damage to plants

Finally, news about plant winter.

The beginning of winter has been difficult for many plants.

Therefore, plants may suffer winter damage.

December was rainy and there was only a little snow. Then came severe frosts.

The wet ground froze. The plants had no proper protection from the snow.

Therefore, the roots of the plants can be damaged.

Gardener **Tuomas Kauppila** says that the damage only becomes visible in spring and summer.

For example, an apple tree may bloom in the spring, but it may die later in the summer.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Friday the weather will be mostly cloudy.

The temperature is between -7 and -15 degrees.

If the cloud cover breaks, it could be even colder.
