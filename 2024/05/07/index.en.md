## Armories

First news about the Finnish army.

The Finnish army begins to store weapons in other countries as well.

The Finnish army already has a warehouse in Norway. It was founded last fall.

In addition, Finland is planning warehouses in Sweden and other countries as well.

The goal is that, in a crisis situation, weapon stocks can be found in different places.

That is why the Finnish army is starting to store weapons abroad as well.

Finland is also preparing for other NATO countries to establish weapons depots in Finland.

For example, the USA can store weapons in Finland for military exercises and crisis situations.

## Posti jobs

Posti plans to reduce employees. Up to 250 employees may lose their jobs.

The reason is that Posti plans to stop distributing advertisements and free magazines.

In addition, there will be changes to the work at the Tampere postal center, which will reduce jobs.

Posti plans to focus on online shopping in Tampere. Mail processing is to be done mechanically in Helsinki.

Posti plans to cut more employees.

Already earlier in the spring, Posti announced the reduction of employees in transport and terminal tasks.

Posti has approximately 15,000 employees in Finland.

## Pay equality

Yet another piece of news about working life.

Women get better pay if the owner or manager of the company is a woman.

Female managers therefore pay women a better salary than male managers. This is what the research institute Labore says.

Researcher **Veera Nippala** says that women usually get paid 10 percent less than men for the same work. If the owner of the company is a woman, the pay gap is smaller.

Pay equality between women and men is better realized in companies whose manager is a woman. This is especially the case in service industries.

CEO of the cleaning company **Terhi Kotkansalo**:

*- Well, yes, we do. We've been keeping track of this for a long time, and it's a matter of course for us.*

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

On Wednesday, the weather will be sunny and cool.

The temperature is mainly 4\...9 degrees.
