First, news about working life.

A lot of people who have studied at a university move out of Finland.

It is a problem for Finland, because Finland needs employees with a high level of education.

More than 15,000 people who have studied at a university move out of Finland every year. Half of them are foreigners.

Foreign students who move away usually do not return to Finland.

Researchers say that foreign students need to be given more help when they are looking for work. Companies also need to hire foreigners more boldly.

## Obesity drugs

Then the news about obesity drugs.

New drugs treat obesity better and better.

The best obesity drugs can reduce a person's weight by 20 percent per year.

According to researchers, there are more than a million obese people in Finland.

Obesity can cause many health problems. It costs Finnish healthcare more than one billion euros per year.

Pharmaceutical companies have spent a lot of money on developing obesity drugs.

New obesity drugs treat obesity better and better.
