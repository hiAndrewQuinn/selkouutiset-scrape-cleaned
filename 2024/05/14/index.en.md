## Heat pumps

First, news about the heating.

Problems have been noticed in the use of heat pumps.

Many housing associations have acquired heat pumps because the price of oil and gas has risen.

The heat pump takes heat energy from, for example, the air or the ground and uses it to heat the building.

However, such large heat pump systems have not always worked well. Only a little money has been saved in heating.

Often the reason is that building societies do not know how to use the automation of heat pumps.

There are problems with the use of heat pumps.

That is why the real estate industry hopes for common guidelines for the design and construction of heat pumps.

## Ahtisaari memorial

Then the news about the memorial.

The monument to President Martti Ahtisaari has been chosen.

The monument will be shaped like an olive leaf. The olive leaf is a symbol of peace, and Ahtisaari was known for peace work.

The designer of the monument is Harri Pakarinen. Pakarinen's plan was presented yesterday, and Ahtisaari's family was also present.

The monument to President Ahtisaari has therefore been chosen.

The memorial will be placed at the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki, where Ahtisaari's grave is. Ahtisaari died last year.

Martti Ahtisaari was the president of Finland from 1994 to 2000. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008.

Then sports.

Yesterday, Finland beat Norway in the World Hockey Championships, i.e. the world championships. Finland won the game 4 - 1.

Finland's goal scorers were Oliver Kapanen and Arttu Hyry. Both scored 2 goals.

This is how Finland beat Norway in the World Hockey Championships yesterday.

Finland has now played 3 games. On Sunday, Finland beat Britain.

Next, Finland plays against Austria on Thursday.
