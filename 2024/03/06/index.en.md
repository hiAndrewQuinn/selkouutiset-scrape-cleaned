New strikes. Poaching. Bad behavior at cultural events. Weather.

## Strikes

First, information about strikes.

New strikes are starting next Monday. They last 2 weeks at this point.

SAK's unions said in the morning that the strikes will affect, for example, exports, imports and logistics.

The strike, for example, closes the freight traffic of ports and trains. Passenger traffic operates normally.

There are also many large factories and distribution terminals. SAK is Finland's largest professional central organization.

New strikes are starting next Monday. They oppose the legal reforms of working life that the government intends to make.

The unions are ready to call off the strikes if the government moderates the proposals. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has invited the social partners to a meeting on Friday.

## Poaching

The suspect is 34 men.

The police say that the poaching has been extensive, planned and continued for many years. Other people in the community also knew about the actions.
