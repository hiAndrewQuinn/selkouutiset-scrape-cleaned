The topic of the news week is the fatigue of Finns.

Many Finns feel tired. Fatigue is a common problem.

## Reasons

Fatigue is one of the most common reasons people go to the doctor.

However, fatigue is usually not a disease, but a consequence of many things.

Fatigue can be caused by being busy, a bad work atmosphere, lifestyle, or because a person's everyday life is too fast-paced.

The constant flood of information and social media, for example, can also increase fatigue.

## Work burnout

One type of fatigue is burnout.

Burnout is related to work and the workload.

The causes of burnout can be too much work, a bad atmosphere at the workplace, or the fact that the work does not motivate the person.

Many Finns seek sick leave due to burnout, even though the causes of burnout may lie in the workplace and not in the person.

## Individual

Mona Mannevuo, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, says that fatigue was previously considered a common problem in the workplace. It was solved by organizing work better.

It is now common to think that fatigue is an individual problem. That is why people seek help from a doctor.

Often, a doctor prescribes sick leave, even though the reason may be work, life circumstances, or everyday stress.

## Coping

Fatigue affects people of all ages.

It can affect your ability to work, study, and spend your free time.

If fatigue continues for a long time, everyday life becomes more difficult and stamina decreases.

Fatigue is often treated with the same instructions as before.

Experts advise that people should get enough sleep, eat healthily, exercise, and get enough rest during their free time.

The instructions have been the same for decades, even though life has become busier.

Researcher Mannevuo says that the problem is that the rush of working life and everyday life is only increasing. No one is saying that the pace needs to slow down.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was fatigue and burnout.

Fatigue affects many people's everyday lives and requires attention both at work and in their free time.
