Unemployment. Yle's salary machine. Ski school. Weather.

## Unemployment

The first topic is unemployment.

The number of unemployed people has increased.

In January, there were over 30,000 more unemployed than a year ago.

There are also more laid off people. Those who have been furloughed still have a job, but they are on compulsory leave without pay.

The number of unemployed people has therefore increased.

However, Elina Pylkk√§nen from the Ministry of Labor and Economic Affairs sees signs that the situation is starting to improve. For example, the number of open jobs has started to increase.

The number of unemployed people decreases when the economic situation improves. There has already been good news about the economy, for example the rise in prices has slowed down and some loan interest rates have turned down.

## Ylen's salary machine

Yet another piece of news about working life.
