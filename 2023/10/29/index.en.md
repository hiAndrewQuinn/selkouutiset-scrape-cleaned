A book fair has been held in Helsinki this weekend. The book fair also included plain language literature and plain language authors. At the book fair, for example, it was celebrated that a plain language version of the author **Merete Mazzarella**'s book *Violetti hetki* has been made.

At the book fair, a large open book discussion was also held, where books in open language were discussed.

There are approximately 750,000 people in Finland who cannot read literature in the common language. They can get reading experiences from plain language books. Nonfiction is also needed because Finns' reading skills and interest in reading have decreased.
