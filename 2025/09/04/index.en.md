Next news about home services for the disabled.

Many people with disabilities find it difficult to get enough help at home.

Assistance for the disabled has been reduced because welfare districts are saving money.

Let's give an example. Alexandra Kylmäaho, who has cerebral palsy, moved from Helsinki to Oulu. In Helsinki, she had her own assistant at home all the time.

In Oulu, Kylmäaho has to be alone at home for 14 hours a day. During that time, he can't go to the bathroom, for example.

The welfare district says it cannot provide help at home for 24 hours.
