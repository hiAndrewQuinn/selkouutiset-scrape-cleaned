## Kindergarten strike

First, the strike news.

Many kindergartens are closed because of the strike.

The strike started today, Tuesday, and will continue tomorrow, Wednesday.

Many kindergarten workers are therefore absent from work for 2 days.

The strike closes daycare centers in the Helsinki region and many other large cities.

Many kindergartens are closed because of the strike.

There are many strikes in Finland now. Strikes are political.

The workers' unions oppose the government's plans with strikes.

The unions say the government intends to weaken social security and workers' rights.

## Stubb in Florence

Then the topic is the next president of Finland, Alexander Stubb.

This is the Italian city of Florence, where Stubb has been working for the past few years. He has been a director and professor at the European University Institute.

Yle reporter Jenna Vehvil√§inen went to ask Stubb's colleagues in Florence what kind of man Stubb is.

Colleagues say that Stubb lives a healthy life. In Florence, he went to bed at 9 in the evening, woke up at 5 in the morning and came to work by bicycle.

At work, Stubb also had time for students.

Finally, we go to Stubb's lunch place in Florence. Here is Stubb's favorite dish with avocado, spinach, willows, egg and tortilla.

## Laskainen

Then the subject of the lasikain.

Today is Countdown Tuesday, which means it's time to count down the hill.

There are laskiais events in different parts of Finland.

For example, in Helsinki, students have organized a laskiais party in Kaivopuisto today.

Pea soup and laskias buns are eaten at laskiai events.

In Finland, it's laskainen at the same time as carnival in many other countries.

The idea is the same, i.e. a joyful celebration before fasting. Fasting is in the Christian tradition before Easter.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

It is snowing in a large part of the country. It will snow 2-10 centimeters.

Cloudiness varies in the east.

The temperature is close to zero in the south.

In the east and north it is -15 degrees.

The wind is blowing.
