Wind turbines. Icebreaker order. Swedish Eurovision. Early potatoes. Weather.

## Wind turbines

Initially, the topic is wind turbines.

There are plans to regulate a minimum distance for wind turbines from settlements. The government is currently considering the matter.

The minimum distance is intended to ensure that the power plant does not disturb residents in the surrounding area.

There are already a couple of thousand wind turbines in Finland. They often make a humming and whirring sound, and their blades can flicker in clear weather.

For this reason, a minimum distance will be set between wind turbines and settlements.

Today, sufficient distance is calculated using modeling, which takes into account, for example, hills and forests between the power plant and houses.

A sufficient distance has usually been 800-1000 meters to the nearest house.

## Icebreaker to Canada

Then we'll talk about the icebreaker order.

Helsinki Shipyard is building an icebreaker for the Government of Canada.

According to Canadian media, the order is worth approximately 2 billion euros.

The order will bring approximately 500 new jobs to the Helsinki shipyard.

Construction of the icebreaker will begin in Helsinki, but it will be completed in Canada.

The completed icebreaker will be handed over to the Canadian government in 2030.

## Swedish Eurovision

Then Eurovision news from the weekend.

Finnish band KAJ will represent Sweden at this spring's Eurovision Song Contest in Switzerland.

KAJ won the Swedish Eurovision qualifiers with the song Bara bada bastu. The song is about sauna bathing.

The KAJ band comes from Ostrobothnia, from the small municipality of Vöyri near Vaasa.

## Potato planting

One more thing about early potatoes.

The first early potatoes of the spring have already been planted in Rymättylä in Southwest Finland.

Potato growers say that plantings are 2 weeks ahead of schedule.

The goal is to have early potatoes on the table when the new graduates celebrate their graduation ceremony at the end of May.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The sun will shine widely tomorrow. In the south, there may be more cloudiness in places.

The wind has turned north. The weather is getting colder.
