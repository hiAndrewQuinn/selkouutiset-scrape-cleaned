Minced meat. Union membership. KalPa. Tuesday's weather.

## Minced meat shortage

First, news from home.

There is a shortage of ground beef in stores. This situation has been going on for a few months now.

The reason is the increase in demand and the decrease in production.

The number of cows in Finland is decreasing.

More milk is produced from one cow than before. Therefore, there is not as much need for cows on a dairy farm as before.

The profitability of beef cattle farming has also declined.

There is a shortage of ground beef in stores because the number of cows is decreasing.

The situation is the same in many other European countries.

## Tax change on union membership fees

Now for some news about politics.

The tax change on union membership fees may affect the scope of collective agreements.

The right to deduct trade union membership fees from taxes will end. This was decided by the government in April during the budget debate.

For example, in Sweden, the same change reduced the number of union members. This graph shows the decline in membership.

Employers will also lose the right to deduct tax on membership fees of employers' associations.

**Merja Kauhanen**, a researcher at the Labore research institute, estimates that the changes may reduce employee and employer membership in unions.

*"It can reduce employee organization and can also reduce the willingness of employers to join employer organizations."*

The tax change on union membership fees may affect the scope of collective agreements.

This could lead to some people's employment contract terms being weakened.

## KalPa is the Finnish champion in ice hockey

Finally, sports news.

Kuopio-based ice hockey club KalPa won the Finnish ice hockey championship on Saturday. KalPa won the final series with a 4-2 victory over SaiPa.

The Finnish championship is KalPa's first.

That's why it was celebrated in a big way, first at the ice rink and later at Kuopio Market Square.

The ice hockey club KalPa is the Finnish ice hockey champion.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, it will rain and sleet in the south in the morning.

It's already light during the day, meaning it's not raining.

The weather is cold. It's freezing at night, but the sun warms it up during the day.
