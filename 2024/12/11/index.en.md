Physical fitness of schoolchildren. Adult literacy and numeracy skills. Energy storage in sand. Thursday's weather.

## Schoolchildren's condition

First, news about the physical condition of schoolchildren.

In rural areas, half of eighth grade girls are in poor health.

This is what the new Move measurement says. 5th and 8th grade students participated in the measurement.

Almost 40 percent of them had such poor physical performance that it can harm their health and well-being.

Children's physical ability is worse in rural areas than in cities.

One of the reasons for that may be that in rural areas the journeys are so long that children sit in the car a lot.

The good news from the Move measurement is that the physical functioning of fifth graders is better than before.

## Adult skill level

Then news about adults.

Finnish adults have good reading skills and good numerical skills.

This is according to a study carried out by the OECD organization.

31 countries participated in the study.

Finland was the best in both literacy and numeracy.

Researchers say that adult education works well in Finland.

Finns have the opportunity to develop their own skills even in adulthood.

## Energy storage

Then the topic is energy.

In the future, energy can perhaps be stored in sand.

This Finnish company studies how energy is stored in sand and how it can be used.

For example, a lot of wind power is obtained when the weather is suitable. Therefore, the excess energy must be recovered.

The company is already able to store energy in large sand tanks, i.e. sand radiators. They provide heat to homes.

If the company manages to raise the temperature of the sand radiator to 800 degrees, really hot steam can be produced. It can be used to turn turbines, which convert the stored energy into electricity.

In the future, energy will probably be stored in sand.

That's how you get environmentally friendly and affordable electricity.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Thursday, the weather will be cloudy. It may snow in Merialeu, Lapland and the east, but the sun shines elsewhere.

It's freezing all over the country. In Lapland, it can be up to 10 degrees below zero. Winds can be strong in Lapland.
