The prime minister's talk. Medical waste. Reading. Weather.

## The prime minister's conversation

First, the topic of preventing discrimination.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has organized a discussion on discrimination.

The discussants considered how discrimination can be prevented in working life. There were also representatives from immigrant organizations.

After the discussion, the Prime Minister told what was decided to be done next.

Orpo said that the purpose is to encourage employers to hire people from different backgrounds. In addition, counseling for immigrants who start their own company will be added.

Prime Minister Orpo therefore organized a discussion on discrimination and its prevention.

Orpo promised such discussions last summer, when some ministers' old racist writings angered people.

## Pharmaceutical waste

Then the news about the medicines.

In Finland, many old medicines are thrown away.

People can leave old medicines in the pharmacy return boxes.

Every year, more than 80 million euros worth of medicines that can no longer be used are thrown into return boxes.

Painkillers are thrown away the most.

In Finland, many old medicines are thrown away.

One reason is that medicine packages are often large. For example, you don't always have time to use painkillers before they are already old.

## Reading

Then the subject of reading.

Finns spend less time reading than before.

Reading has decreased among people of all ages.

However, reading has decreased the most among young people, says Juha Haaramo from Statistics Finland.

He says the reason is screen time. Social media takes time away from young women. Young men, on the other hand, play a lot on digital devices.

Less time is spent reading than before.

Sari Jokinen from the Teachers' Trade Union is worried about this.

He reminds that good reading skills help young people in all subjects and later also in working life.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will mostly rain, meaning it won't rain.

Almost the entire country is cloudy, but the sun is shining in North Ostrobothnia.

The temperature is on the plus side in a large part of the country. It's freezing in Lapland.
