There have been many dangerous incidents at the beaches this week. Many children have almost drowned in the water.

There have been cases at least in Espoo, Turku, Tampere and Helsinki.

The children were in the water, but the parents were not near the children. Other adults and lifeguards rescued the children from the water.

For example, there have been at least 4 dangerous incidents in Aurinkolahti, Helsinki, this week.

In Espoo, two young people rescued a child who had already sunk underwater.

The police are investigating whether a crime has been committed when a parent has not supervised a child.

## The main task of a lifeguard is to supervise

A lifeguard has a demanding job.

This summer, the City of Helsinki received 240 applications for the position of swimming lifeguard. 40 were selected.

Some cities don't have enough qualified lifeguards.

For example, a lifeguard must know how to call the emergency number, summon help, and provide first aid.

Lifeguards say it's difficult to identify a drowning person without training.

Martti Merra, Sports Director of the City of Espoo, says that the lifeguard's job is to monitor the beach and its safety.

The main task is not to be a lifesaver.

Police say that an adult is always responsible for a child's safety. You can only properly supervise a child if you are in the water and right next to the child.

## More and more children cannot swim

More and more children cannot swim.

In Finland, swimming skills have traditionally been a civic skill. The Nordic countries have defined what swimming skills mean.

A skilled swimmer can surface from deep underwater and swim continuously for 200 meters. Of that, 50 meters must be on their back.

Only half of 6th graders can swim anymore. During the Corona period, not all children were able to attend swimming school.

Immigrants' swimming skills are also often poor. Sometimes no one in an immigrant family can swim.

Many cities have their own swimming schools for immigrants.

## Repetition

The topic of the week in the news was the dangers of beaches.

More and more children cannot swim. Adults are not supervising children enough.

Police are investigating this week's dangerous incidents on the beaches.
