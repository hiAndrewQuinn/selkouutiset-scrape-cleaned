Winter traffic. Eastern border. Polar night. Weather.

## Snowfall and traffic

First, news about traffic.

Snowfall causes traffic problems.

It has snowed today, especially in southern Finland. More than 20 centimeters of snow has fallen in some places.

A thick layer of snow has hindered traffic, and many small car crashes have occurred in the Helsinki region, for example.

Snowfall causes problems in traffic again.

It has snowed often this winter, and the plows have had a lot of work to do.

Department manager Lars Westermark from the Highways Agency says that the work of plow trucks in the Helsinki region can be difficult.

The roads have to be plowed early because there is a lot of traffic. When the morning rush hour starts, plow cars can no longer fit into the traffic.

That's why it's hard to maintain roads if it's snowing all day.

## Eastern border and obstacles

Then the news about Finland's eastern border.

Perhaps more barriers will be built on Finland's eastern border, i.e. the border between Finland and Russia.

Temporary barriers can be built on the eastern border to prevent people from crossing the border without permission.

The border between Finland and Russia is more than 1300 kilometers long. About 70 percent of the border is forest.

However, there will be no obstacles along the entire eastern border.

{core sentence} Maybe more obstacles will be built on the border with Finland's eastern border.

Temporary barriers are now being planned, which will only be on the border for a while.

It has already been decided that a permanent fence will be built in some parts of the eastern border.

## The end of Kaamos

Let's also say that this winter's camouflage is over.

During Kaamos, the sun does not rise in the sky at all in Lapland.

Today the sun rose again in the sky also in Nuorgam, which is Finland's northernmost village.

The sun was in the sky for 1 hour and 5 minutes.

That's how the chaos ended, which lasted about 2 months in Nuorgam.

## Weather

Another weather forecast. Tomorrow it will snow in the east. In some places, it may snow a little elsewhere. However, it does not rain in a large part of Finland.

The sun shines in the north and in some places also in the south.

The frost is 10-20 degrees in most of the country.
