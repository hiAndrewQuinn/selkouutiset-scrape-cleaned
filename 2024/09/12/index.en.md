The price of electricity. Dog in the car. Kom theater premiere. Weather.

## Electricity price

The first topic is the price of electricity.

Electricity costs more now than in the summer. The price of electricity has risen a lot during September.

The price of electricity is raised, for example, by the fact that only a small amount of wind power is produced now. In addition, maintenance work is carried out in large power plants. There is a fault in the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant, and Olkiluoto 2 is not producing electricity at the moment.

Electricity costs more now than in the summer. Tonight, electricity costs almost 50 cents per kilowatt hour. As recently as yesterday, Wednesday, electricity cost about 10 cents per kilowatt hour.

## Dog in the car

Now the topic is dogs and driving.

The dog must be put in a cage or harness when driving a car. This is what Liikenneturva says.

It is dangerous to keep a dog off leash in the car. If there is a crash in traffic, the dog can fly into the car driver's neck or through the car's glass.

The dog must be put in a cage or harness when driving a car. There are various car harnesses and cages for dogs. Liikenneturva says that the dog's cage or harness must be chosen carefully. Not all models have been tested in a car.

## Kom theater premiere

Now culture.

In the KOM theater in Helsinki, a play is performed, the subject of which is shame. The name of the play is *Seven stories about shame*.

The play was written by Icelander Tyrfingfur Tyrfinggson. He says the play also aims to reduce the shame the audience feels. Tyrfinggson thinks people have too much shame.

A play with the theme of shame is performed at the KOM theater. The premiere of the play was on Wednesday. The performances will continue until December.
