Taxation. Immigrants' job search. The clearest statement of the year. Weather.

## Taxation

First, some news about taxation.

The Tax Administration has published data on last year's taxation. The data shows who earned the most money last year and also paid the most tax.

The Tax Administration says that a total of approximately 45 billion euros in income taxes were collected last year.

Last year, the highest earner in Finland was Mikko Kuusi, founder of the food delivery company Wolt. He earned over 80 million euros.

Yle publishes tax information for all Finns who earn over 150,000 euros. The information can be viewed on the tax machine on Yle's website.

## Job search for immigrants

Then the topic is immigrants' job search.

Immigrants say that poor language skills make it difficult to get a job in Finland. In the Helsinki region, over 60 percent of unemployed immigrants say that it is difficult to get a job if they do not speak Finnish properly.

Many immigrants also say that it is difficult to find work if you don't know native Finns.

The information is revealed in a research article published by the City of Helsinki.

Sahar Said, a native of Helsinki, has studied for four degrees.

When he lived in Germany for a while, he got a job right away. In Finland, he hasn't even gotten a job interview.

## Outspoken of the Year

Finally, award news.

This year, the University of Helsinki and Professor Tiina Onikki-Rantajääskö will receive the "Clear-Speaker of the Year" award.

Professor Onikki-Rantajääskö has developed plain language university education. It provides a model for plain language teaching for other universities as well.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Thursday. It will snow in the north, and rain elsewhere.

Wind gusts can be strong throughout the country.

It's freezing in Lapland, plus degrees elsewhere
