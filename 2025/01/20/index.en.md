The prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas has begun.

## Taxation of used goods

Finally, news about the taxation of used goods.

Double taxation of recycled goods is a problem for many companies.

This is the recycled clothing section at Sokos department store.

VAT has been paid on these clothes when they were sold new. When the store sells a recycled product, tax is paid again.

Double taxation of recycled goods is a problem for many companies.

The recycling company and the trade association say that double taxation distorts competition.

For example, fast fashion may be cheaper than recycled clothing. This may reduce domestic clothing sales.

However, taxation cannot be changed easily. If taxation is to be changed, an EU decision is needed.

## Tuesday weather

Snow will fall in the south and west on Tuesday.

The sun shines in the east and north.

It's freezing all over the country.

In the east and north, the temperature can be 15 or even 30 degrees below zero.
