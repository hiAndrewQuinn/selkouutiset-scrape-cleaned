\- Everything has changed. We have a new home, I have two new roles, both as the president's spouse, but also at Aalto University.

Before the presidential election, he worked at the elevator company Kone. After the elections, he transferred to Aalto University.

The job is part-time because Innes-Stubb also needs time for the duties of the president's spouse.

How do you see your own role as the president's spouse?

\- I hope I can use my skills for the good of Finland and take Finland's message forward both at home and in the world.

Before, the spouse of the president was called the mother of the country. What thoughts does this evoke in you?

\- Earth's mother sounds a bit old in my opinion. I think the president's spouse is a little more neutral, and I like that better.

You also have your own work and career. How is there enough time for everything? Is there enough time for everything?

\- Yeah, I'm trying to find my own rhythm, I'm quite busy, but luckily the work at Aalto University is flexible and part-time, and that means I have time to work on my job as the president's spouse as well.

## Wide range of languages
