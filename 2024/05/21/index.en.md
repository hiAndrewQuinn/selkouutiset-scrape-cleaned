Yesterday, the chairmen of RKP, Christian Democrats and Liike Nyt participated in the European election exam.

They discussed, for example, how the EU makes decisions.

Today, security policy is also decided in the EU in such a way that all EU countries must agree on the matter.

Sari Essayah of the Christian Democrats and Harry Harkimo of Liike Nyt think it's a good thing.

RKP chairperson Anna-Maja Henriksson hopes that in the future the support of the majority of EU countries will be enough for security policy decisions.

Yle's European election exams started yesterday, and they will continue today and tomorrow.

There are always chairmen of 3 different parties.
