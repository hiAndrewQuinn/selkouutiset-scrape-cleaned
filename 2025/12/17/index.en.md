First, about European defense.

Orpo said that Finland and Poland are coordinating the defense projects of the eastern EU countries.

At the same time, Finland is getting new fighter jets. Finland's first F-35 fighter jet has been unveiled in Texas, USA. The planes will arrive in Finland in a year.

Finland decided to purchase 64 multi-role fighters from the USA in 2021. The total value of the project is approximately 10 billion euros.
