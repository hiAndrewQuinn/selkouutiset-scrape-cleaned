Work and unemployment

This time in the news week we talk about work and unemployment.

Finding a job can be difficult now. There are fewer and fewer job openings available.

Even nurses and healthcare professionals are finding it increasingly difficult to find work.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## Job vacancies decreased

There are fewer job openings available now than before.

The Ministry of Employment and the Economy reports that there were a total of approximately 43,000 job vacancies in December. This is approximately 40,000 fewer than a year ago.

New job openings have decreased in almost all occupational groups.

The number of jobs is not increasing because Finland's economic growth is so weak, says Elina Pylkkänen, Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.

## There is still work for nurses

The number of jobs has decreased, but there is still some work to be found.

Statistics Finland reports that the most work is available for nurses and other healthcare workers.

However, job openings in healthcare have decreased since last year. Due to financial constraints, many welfare areas are also laying off nurses and other employees.

There are also jobs for salespeople and cleaners, but there are fewer job openings in these fields than before.

Undersecretary of State Elina Pylkkänen says that there are also jobs for artificial intelligence experts.

## The number of unemployed people is increasing

As fewer jobs become available, the number of unemployed people increases.

The Ministry of Employment and the Economy reported yesterday that there were over 300,000 unemployed people at the end of December.

About 100,000 of them have been unemployed for over a year.

There are also more and more people with a university degree who are unemployed.
