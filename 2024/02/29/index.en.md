## NATO military exercise

First, news about the military exercise.

Finland participates in the large military exercise of the defense alliance NATO in the north.

For the first time, Finland is participating in such a large exercise during NATO membership.

The training starts on Monday of next week, and it lasts for 2 weeks. The purpose is to practice defending Northern Europe.

The exercise is led by Norway.

Norwegian and American soldiers have already gathered in northern Norway. From there, the exercise also progresses to the regions of Northern Finland and Northern Sweden.

Finland is participating in NATO's major military exercise.

More than 20,000 soldiers from 14 countries will participate in the exercise. More than 4,000 Finnish soldiers are involved.

## Maze shops

Then we go to the store.

Maze shops are becoming more common.

Maze shops have a corridor with lots of twists and turns.

The customer often has to walk the entire aisle from beginning to end in order to get to the checkout.

Along the corridor, the customer can see almost all the store's products. That's why he also buys more.

Such labyrinthine shops are becoming more common.

They are a good way for the store to use the space efficiently and increase sales.

## Slipping

Finally, the subject of slipping.

The streets are really slippery now.

The temperature varies on both sides of zero. Sometimes the snow melts and freezes again in freezing weather.

That's why there have been a particularly high number of slip accidents this winter.

Every year, 70,000 Finns slip and fall so badly that they have to see a doctor.

Often people also feel ashamed if they fall. Falling is embarrassing for many people.

The streets are really slippery now.

However, the ice on the streets is quickly decreasing, because the temperature stays on the positive side for many days.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

Cloudy weather continues.

The whole country has degrees of heat, that is, the temperature is positive. In the south it can be almost 5 degrees.

It may snow or rain a little.

The wind calms down a bit, so it's not so strong anymore.
