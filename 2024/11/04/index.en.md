## Turku Compass Hospital

Then we will get to know the new hospital.

A new hospital has opened in Turku.

The name of the hospital is Compass Hospital.

Compass Hospital is a new type of psychiatric hospital. The building doesn't even look like a hospital.

The idea is that the hospital is part of the environment and society. Mental health patients are not taken away from the eyes of others.

Turku Kompassisairaila was opened at the end of October.

## Week of Swedishness

Then the subject is the Swedish language.

Today begins the week of Swedishness.

The theme of the week is that Swedish is Finland's second official language.

These men speak Swedish at work, even though the other's mother tongue is Finnish.

They say that language mistakes don't hurt. The workplace for men is the theater, and there people are not afraid of mistakes.

So the week of Swedishness starts today.

On Wednesday, we celebrate Swedishness Day. It is a special holiday for Swedish-speaking Finns, or Finno-Swedes.

Almost 300,000 Finns speak Swedish as their mother tongue.

## Weekend storm

There was a storm in Finland at the weekend.

The wind was so strong that a hurricane was measured for the first time in Finland. The hurricane was measured at sea.

The wind was also strong on land, and it knocked down trees on top of power lines. Therefore, many homes were without electricity.

The repair work will continue for several days.

Tomorrow, the rain zone will pass over Finland. It is snowing in Lapland. Elsewhere, it first snows, and then rains.

The temperature rises when the rain zone has passed. In the west, the temperature is above 5 degrees. Elsewhere it is below 5 degrees.
