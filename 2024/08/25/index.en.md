We want to improve services for job seekers. Therefore, the responsibility for labor force services will soon be transferred to the municipalities.

At the same time, TE offices will cease to operate. TE offices, i.e. employment and business offices, will be abolished at the end of this year.

TE offices have helped people to find a job. From the beginning of next year, job seekers will receive help from the municipalities.

Municipalities are also closer to their own residents. Therefore, they know best what kind of employment services the municipality's residents need. Municipalities also know well the companies in their own area, to which they also start providing employment services.

The purpose is that better employment services help reduce unemployment.

## Unemployment increased in a year

Unemployment has increased in Finland, says Statistics Finland.

There were about 230,000 unemployed people in July. There are now over 30,000 more unemployed people than a year ago.

The figures did not surprise Labor Minister Arto Sato. Unemployment has not yet decreased because companies are still doing poorly, says Satonen.

However, he believes that the situation is going in a better direction.

The government wants to create 100,000 new jobs. Satonen believes that it is possible to achieve the goal.

## The unemployment situation in Finland is bad

Finland's unemployment situation is bad if Finland is compared to other European Union countries. Only in Spain and Greece is the unemployment situation even worse than in Finland.

Economic growth has been slower in Finland than in other EU countries. The expert says that high interest rates slow down the growth of Finnish companies. Therefore, no new jobs have been created in Finland.

In addition, Russia's war in Ukraine has harmed the economy in Finland more than in other EU countries.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was unemployment and services for job seekers. Let's repeat the most important things.

Unemployment has increased in Finland.

Services for job seekers will be transferred to municipalities, and TE offices will be discontinued.
