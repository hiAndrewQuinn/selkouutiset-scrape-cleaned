Russia invaded Ukraine almost 3 years ago. The war began in February 2022.

Since then, many Ukrainians have fled the war. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians have come to Finland.

In Finland and other European Union countries, Ukrainians can receive temporary protection. The EU has decided that temporary protection for Ukrainians will continue until March 2026.

Ukrainians can work and study during temporary protection. The Finnish government also wants Ukrainians to be able to work in Finland.

A survey by the Ministry of the Interior shows that Ukrainians are happy in Finland. More than 90 percent of Ukrainians are satisfied with life in Finland, and about half of them plan to stay in Finland.

Many Ukrainian families plan to stay in Finland, especially for safety and the future of their children.

## Petrenko family

Yle met two Ukrainian families living in Finland during Christmas. The families come from southern Ukraine, near the Black Sea.

The Petrenko family now lives in Forssa. The family has decided to stay in Finland. The main reason for this is the children, who want to live in Finland.

The family is doing well. The parents have found jobs, and the family is already getting by without benefits.

The Petrenko family's dream is to have their own small house near the forest. The dream didn't come true in Ukraine because of the war, but the family believes it can come true in Finland.

## Liashchevsky family

The Liashchevsky family lives in a reception center in Espoo. The family receives a small reception allowance.

The Liashchevskys have not yet decided whether the family will stay in Finland. They miss their relatives and Ukraine.

However, the most important thing is health. The father of the family had cancer and the daughter has diabetes. They have received good treatment in Finland.
