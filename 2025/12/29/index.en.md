Unemployment. The British Ambassador and the Finnish language. Wednesday's weather. Christmas break for mainstream news.

## Unemployment

First, the news about the number of unemployed people.

Unemployment continues to rise.

Statistics Finland reports that there were 50,000 more unemployed people in November than a year ago.

The total number of unemployed people was almost 280,000.

The unemployment rate was 10.6 percent.

Unemployment continues to rise.

## The British Ambassador and the Finnish language

Now we will meet the British Ambassador to Finland.

Ambassador **Laura Davies** has only lived in Helsinki for a little over a year, but she already speaks good Finnish.

– I don't speak Finnish very well. I try, but it doesn't always work, or even usually.

Finnish is not the only special language the ambassador has studied.

– My native language is English, but I also speak French because I studied in a French school as a child. When I lived in Ethiopia, I learned a little Amharic and also Sinhala when I worked in Sri Lanka.

Ambassador Laura Davies says that Finnish is, however, the most difficult language she has studied.

– Because it's different, it's also more difficult. I have to think about many different things at the same time.

– For example, break, but on a break, or floor, but on the floor. Or Turku, in Turku, but Rovaniemi, in Rovaniemi. Why? My shit is getting mixed up!

And what word or words are difficult?

– I usually say that the sleepless nights are the hardest, but that's not true. The most challenging thing for me is quite embarrassing because it's the United Kingdom. Really embarrassing because it's the name of my own country and I'm here as an ambassador.

Do you have a favorite word in Finnish?

– Yeah, the warmer one is always the cutest in the world. But also a cute bunny and a cloud service. Really, really cute: a cloud service. And in many other countries.

Here are the ambassador's tips for other Finnish language students:

– Finnish grammar is rich, i.e. complex, I recommend language lessons. And the other is to listen to podcasts in easy Finnish and read textbooks, it works really well.

## Wednesday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Christmas Eve, the weather will be mostly clear in southern and central Finland.

In parts of Lapland it is raining, sleet or snowing.

The temperature is between +1 and -10 degrees.

## Christmas break for news channels

Clear News is now on a Christmas break.

The next time the news will be out is January 7th.

Merry Christmas and goodbye.
