Russia is still the biggest threat to Finland's security. That's what the Protection Police says.

In Russia's opinion, Finland is not a friendly country. Russia does not like the fact that Finland joined the defense alliance NATO.

Russia, for example, is spying in Finland. Russia will probably send more asylum seekers to the Finnish border. Russia wants to influence what kind of decisions Finnish politicians make.

However, the Protection Police estimates that Russia's attention is now elsewhere than in Finland. Therefore, Russia will not be a major military threat to Finland in the near future.

The security police say that Finland's membership in the defense alliance NATO gives Finland protection against the Russian threat.

There are many Russian people living in Finland. The security police say that these people are not a threat to Finland's security.

A large part of the Russian people in Finland opposes the Russian regime.

The Protection Police estimates that if the Russian regime collapses, a large number of Russian people will probably not come to Finland.

## Terrorism

The threat of terrorism in Finland is at the same level as before.

The security police estimates that individual people may be planning a terrorist attack in Finland. These people have extreme right-wing or radical Islamist ideas. However, the probability of a terrorist attack in Finland is currently small.

The terrorist organization Isis made a big terrorist attack in Moscow not long ago. The security police say that ISIS is not a big threat in Finland.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was Finland's security. Let's repeat the most important things.

The security police say that Finland's biggest threat is Russia. Russia is spying in Finland and will send more asylum seekers to the Finnish border in the future. The risk of a terrorist attack is no greater in Finland than before.
