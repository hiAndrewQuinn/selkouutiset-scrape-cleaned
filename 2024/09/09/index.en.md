Integration money. Agricultural. Fnnish baseball. Tuesday's weather.

## The money for integration

First, immigration.

Next year, the government will give less money to the integration of immigrants than now.

Money is needed, for example, for immigrants' language training, guidance and counseling.

The government has decided to reduce almost 60 million euros from integration. It brings problems to the municipalities, which have to organize the integration.

This is how Helsinki's immigration director **Glenn Gassen**:

*We cannot leave people without services and expect them to learn Finnish at home in front of a mirror.*

The government reduces money from integration.

In addition, the government plans to save about 3 million euros on interpreting services, for example.

The government's goal is that immigrants' own responsibility increases.

## Agriculture

Then the topic is agriculture.

The autumn weather has been good for agriculture.

The weather has been warm and sunny.

Farmer **Mats Lundqvist**'s autumn work has already progressed a long way.

Here he is sowing autumn grain.

Lundqvist says that he reaped all the spring grain by the end of August.

Never before has he threshed spring grain so early.

The autumn weather has been good for agriculture.

The dry and warm weather has also brought savings. Farmers have not had to dry the grain crop much.

## Baseball

Then sports.

At the weekend, the Finnish women's baseball champion emerged.

The champion team is Manse PP from Tampere.

Manse secured the championship when it got the third (3rd) win in the final series against Lapuan Virki√§.

The joy of the people of Tampere was great when the championship was certain. Mansen's captain **Venla Tanhua** cried for joy.

*You really don't understand how good this feels!*

At the weekend, the Finnish women's baseball champion emerged.

The men's Finnish champion will probably be determined as early as next weekend.

There is fierce competition for the Finnish championship, because baseball is Finland's national game.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is sunny in the east and north. The temperature there is 20-23 degrees.

It is cloudy in the west and there will be showers in places.

The weather will be windy tomorrow. Wind gusts are over 15 meters per second.
