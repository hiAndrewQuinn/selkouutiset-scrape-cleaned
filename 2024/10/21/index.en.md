Directors' salaries. Disabled children. Ähtäri pandas. Tuesday's weather.

## Directors' salaries

The first topic is wages.

Managers' salaries have risen the most in recent years. This is what Statistics Finland says.

Since 2010, managers' salaries have increased by more than 40 percent.

For example, the wages of construction workers have only increased by more than 20 percent in the same time.

Managers' salaries have therefore increased more than others.

Managers' salaries have increased, especially in large private companies. Managers are rewarded if the company does well.

In government jobs, managers' salaries have not risen faster than workers' salaries.

## Disabled children

Then the topic is the rights of disabled children.

Disabled children do not always receive rehabilitation at school.

Many schools do not allow the child to go to rehabilitation during the school day.

This family has a multi-disabled child who has his own counselor at school. However, the school does not allow him to participate in the child's rehabilitation outside of school.

The mother of the family says that there is a lot of stress on the child if a different instructor joins the rehabilitation.

Disabled children do not always receive rehabilitation at school.

However, the UN or United Nations agreement says that rehabilitation must be part of the schooling of disabled children.

## Ähtäri pandas

Then news about panda bears.

The panda house at Ähtäri zoo is open today for the last day.

At the weekend, the animal park was visited by many people who still wanted to see the pandas.

Ähtäri zoo has 2 pandas, Snow and Pyry. They came from China to Finland in 2018.

The intention was that the pandas would stay in Finland for 15 years.

However, today is the last day the panda house at Ähtäri zoo is open, and the zoo will return the pandas to China soon.

The reason is money. Renting and caring for pandas is expensive, but the pandas have not brought enough visitors and box office revenue to the zoo.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is dusty and the sun shines widely. In the southern part of the country, Cloudiness is more abundant in places.

The weather continues to be quite warm. The temperature is 8-12 degrees. Northern Lapland is cooler.
