## Euro election exam

First, the topic is the European elections.

Yesterday, Wednesday, the chairmen of the 3 largest parliamentary parties took part in Yle's European election exam. At the exam were the chairman of the coalition Petteri Orpo, the chairman of Basic Finns Riikka Purra and the chairman of SDP Antti Lindtman.

They discussed, for example, what kind of cooperation different political groups can do in the European Parliament.

The chairmen disagreed a little on whether it is possible to cooperate with, for example, the political far-right in the European Parliament.

The European elections are in June. Election day is June 9.
