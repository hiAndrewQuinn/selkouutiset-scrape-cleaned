Customs. Elections and culture. Weak ice. Weather.

## US customs in Finland

First, the topic is economics.

The US announced this week that it will impose a 20 percent tariff on European products.

Politicians and experts say that tariffs are bad for the Finnish economy. Finland exports a lot of products to the USA.

Finnish company Planmeca makes medical devices. The USA is an important export market for the company. Deputy CEO Jouko Nyk√§nen:

\-*Represents a good 20 percent of our turnover. So it is still very important*.

The tariffs imposed by the US are bad for the Finnish economy. Ministers say that the tariffs are still being negotiated with the US.

## Municipal elections and culture

Now culture.

The result of the municipal elections has great significance for culture.

The state supports culture less than before. Municipalities also have little money. Municipal councils decide how much money the municipality gives to culture and the arts. Libraries, for example, need money.

Johanna Selkee, expert from the Association of Local and Regional Authorities:

\-*The state is making big savings on culture and the finances of municipalities are not in a good state either. It is really important to discuss culture in election debates.*

The results of the municipal elections have a major impact on culture. The municipal elections are on April 13. Regional elections will also be held at the same time.

## Weak ice

The next topic is ice.

You have to be careful on the ice now. The ice on many lakes in southern Finland has already broken up. The ice on the sea can be weak. If the sun is shining, the ice will weaken quickly during the day. There may also be holes in the ice.

The ice is still thick in northern Finland.

You have to be careful on the ice now. The ice may look thick, but a person can still fall into it.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is cold in the south. The temperature is only slightly above zero. In the rest of the country, the temperature is around 0 degrees. It can snow a little sometimes.
