# TV | Clear News | Monday 8.12.2025

Fires. 10 years of TV news. In the village with the audience. Weather.

## Fires

There have been many serious fires in Finland over the weekend.

In Savonlinna, a mother and three children died in a fire in a detached house on Saturday.

One person died in a row house fire in Varkaus yesterday.

A football stadium stand caught fire in Valkeakoski. Police say someone may have started the fire intentionally.

## Birthday

Yle's clear news TV broadcast is celebrating its 10th anniversary.

Yle was the first in the world to start broadcasting plain-language news on television.

The public has especially wanted news from Finland in the newscasts.

Over 800,000 people in Finland need plain language.

Now we're going to meet the audience.

## British Embassy

Ambassador **Laura Davies**.

\- Yle's clear news is wonderful. I watch it almost every day and after watching it I read the text aloud.

\- I appreciate that it is varied. It tells about politics and the economy, but also about culture and small things. For example, Norppalive or Midsummer traffic. It is like a window into Finland.

## Axxell Multicultural Center

Student **Tetyana Korol**.

\- Watching is a good way to learn Finnish, at least for me. It helps me listen to Finnish and develops my language skills. At first I only watched Yle news in plain Finnish, but now I watch all the news that interests me.

\- In addition, I learned new words from different areas of life, such as economics, politics, nature and others.

## Haaviko training center

**Janne Oskari Parkkonen**

\- I really like the news.

What kinds of topics do you want to see news about?

\- Politics. The war in Ukraine. I like cultural news a lot.

**Roni Rasanen**

\- There's a lot of talk in the news about Ukraine and the United States and a lot of politics and cuts, money cuts.

Do you think there is too much news about a certain topic?

\- Nothing. Everything is OK news.

## Milja Service Center

**Annikki Luukkonen**

\- Yes, it was very clear and understood every word. The children were absolutely wonderful.

**Riitta Kemilä**

\- I'm also a big consumer and I watch all the news all day or evening, there's more of it in the evening. I think that clear news is a good invention.

Would you have any greetings for our ten-year-old broadcast now?

**Hilja the Fox**

\- Of course, we can at least congratulate you on the ten-year period and that we are moving forward well.

**Kaarina Häkli**

\- Probably these special groups for whom the news is intended, so add things they need. And then there could be things for the elderly.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, it will snow lightly in the north, and rain or sleet elsewhere.

It is freezing during the day in Lapland. Elsewhere, the temperature is between 0 and +5 degrees.
