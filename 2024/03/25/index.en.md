## Eastern border

The government wants the possibility to prevent asylum seekers from coming to Finland from Russia.

Experts say there are many problems with the law.

International agreements say that a person always has the right to seek asylum. Therefore, the law may violate international agreements.

Last fall, Russia started to refer a lot of asylum seekers to Finland. Russia wanted to cause problems in Finland.
