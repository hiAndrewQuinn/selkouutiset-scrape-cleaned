There are many dangerous level crossings in Finland. There are over 50 extremely dangerous level crossings. A level crossing is dangerous if there is no warning device in front of the railway line. The warning device can be a barrier or a traffic light. At a dangerous level crossing, it is also difficult for a motorist to see whether a train is approaching the crossing.

The authority says that the level crossings must be safer than they are now. However, changing the level crossings costs a lot of money. In addition, the landowner may file a complaint about the new road route. The court process for the complaint will take a long time.

Drivers should approach level crossings with caution. They should drive slowly when the train tracks are nearby. Drivers should look in both directions several times if there are no barriers at the level crossing.

Drivers must remember that the train cannot swerve off the tracks. The train also stops slowly.

If the weather is bad, it may not be advisable to cross the level crossing at all. Drivers should choose an alternative route.
