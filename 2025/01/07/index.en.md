## 5 years since the corona pandemic

Then the topic is the coronavirus pandemic.

Five years have passed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The first cases of the disease were detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. From there, the virus spread rapidly around the world with travelers.

In early March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic.

Borders closed, trade stopped, and people stayed home and worked remotely.

The number of infections still increased rapidly, and many people also died from the coronavirus.

The situation only began to improve when a vaccine against the coronavirus was available in December 2020.

Five years have passed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The virus is still there, but it is no longer as dangerous as it was at the beginning. Vaccines and infections have also improved people's immunity.
