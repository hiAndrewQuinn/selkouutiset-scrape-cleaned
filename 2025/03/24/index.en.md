Police strike. Civil defense shelters. Finnish property. Weather.

## Police strike

First, the police strike.

The police might go on strike.

The police union says a strike is almost certain.

The last time police officers in Finland went on strike was almost 50 years ago.

The employer of the police is the state.

Wage negotiations between the state and its employees are stalled.

The police might go on strike.

If a police strike comes, it doesn't mean that all police officers will stop working.

The law states that a strike must not pose a danger to people's safety.

So some police officers will stay on the job if there is a strike.

## Civil defense shelters

Then the topic of civilian shelters.

Civil defense is now of interest to Finns.

The reason is that the security situation has deteriorated.

People usually go to a bomb shelter during wartime if there is an air raid.

For example, there is a new and really nice civil defense shelter in Merihaka, Helsinki.

The Merihaka civil defense shelter can accommodate at least 6,000 people.

There are 400 toilets with air conditioning.

People are interested in shelters these days.

The situation with civil defense in Helsinki is good.

There is room for all Helsinki residents in Helsinki's shelters.

The law states that a civil defense shelter must be built in all buildings over 1,200 square meters.

That's why, for example, single-family homes rarely have civil defense shelters.

## Property of the Finns

Then the topic is the property of the Finns.

The value of Finns' property has decreased in recent years.

It means that Finns are poorer than before.

The main reason for the decline in property values is the price of housing.

A home is usually the most valuable thing an average Finn owns.

A Finn becomes poorer when the price of his or her home falls.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, it will rain in the east and south. It will snow in Eastern Lapland.

Elsewhere in the country, it doesn't rain and the sun can shine.

The temperature is between +1 and +5 degrees throughout the country.
