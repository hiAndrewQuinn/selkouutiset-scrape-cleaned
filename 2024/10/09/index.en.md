## Russian influence

First, news from Russia.

Russia is looking for people on social media to do sabotage, i.e. destruction. For example, a person is offered money to start an arson.

The protection police say that there are observations of Russian activities in many European countries.

Russia wants to influence and create fear.

This is what **Teemu Liikkanen**, head of counter-intelligence of the protection police, says.

-- *It is influencing through sabotage, of course, and perhaps creating an atmosphere of fear.*

Russia is looking for people to commit sabotage on social media.

Russia uses intermediaries. The perpetrators of the sabotage usually do not know that the commission of the destruction is Russia.

## Nordea's problems

Now news about banking services.

There have been many problems with Nordea bank's services.

For example, you have not been able to access the online bank or you have not been able to pay in the store with a Nordea card. There have been many problems recently.

The last time Nordea's online bank had problems was yesterday Tuesday.

Director **Jani Eloranta** says that the cause of the problems on Tuesday was an update. The update was done at night but it failed.

There have been many problems with Nordea bank's services. One reason may have been denial of service attacks.
