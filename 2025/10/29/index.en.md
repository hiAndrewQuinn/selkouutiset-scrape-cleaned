## Nvidia invests in Nokia

First, economic news.

The world's most valuable company, Nvidia, is investing a billion dollars in Nokia. Nokia is a Finnish telecommunications company.

For example, the American company Nvidia manufactures computer graphics cards and develops artificial intelligence.

Nokia's main products are telecommunications and mobile phone networks. Nokia has not done particularly well in recent years.

Now Nvidia is investing a billion dollars in Nokia.

Nvidia's investment raised Nokia's share price significantly on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Nvidia collaboration brings Nokia more closely involved in the business of artificial intelligence.

Nokia was previously by far the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer.

## The popularity of school meals has declined

Now about school food.

The popularity of school meals has declined sharply in 2 years.

Only slightly more than half of middle school students eat school lunch every day. Just 2 years ago, over 60 percent ate at school.

The quality and taste of the food received poor ratings in the survey. Girls in particular are visiting the canteen less and less often.

The popularity of school meals has declined sharply in 2 years.

The City of Oulu found out what their favorite dishes are. These include pasta dishes, oven sausage, fish sticks, meatballs and salmon soup.

Whole meat sauces and cauliflower and spinach soup are not favorites.

## Fathers are also awarded a medal

Finally, some news about dads.

Fathers will receive a state decoration for the first time this year.

It is the same as the Mother's Day medal, the Order of the White Rose of Finland. 48 fathers receive it.

The President of the Republic **Alexander Stubb** will present decorations on Father's Day next Sunday.

One of the recipients of the badge is **Hannu Välimaa** from Kangasa in Pirkanmaa. He raised his children alone after his wife died.

Välimaa has been very involved in the children's lives:

\- Yes, I've been an example to them and then I've taken them along with me to everything, to these hobbies and everything. That I had to drive them around a lot.
