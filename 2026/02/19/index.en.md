First, the topic is the new Minister of Social Affairs and Health.

**Wille Rydman** of the Finns Party will become the new Minister of Social Affairs and Health.

The chairman of the Finns Party, **Riikka Purra**, announced Rydman's election last night.

Rydman was previously Minister of Economic Affairs in the **Orpo** government for 2 years. Last summer he returned to parliament.

Wille Rydman will replace **Kaisa Juuso** as Minister of Social Affairs and Health. Juuso announced last week that she will be leaving the ministerial post.

Big savings have been planned for social and health services. Wille Rydman says that the savings will be maintained.

## Elderly care

Then we'll talk about eldercare.

Nurses say that the safety of the elderly has deteriorated in nursing homes.

Nurses tell Yle that various dangerous situations have increased.

The nurses' union Super also says that it receives reports of dangerous situations from employees almost every day.

Nurses believe that the number of dangerous situations in nursing homes has increased because the number of nurses has decreased.

Nurse staffing means that in Finland, the law determines how many nurses there must be in a nursing home.

There have been at least 5 deaths in nursing homes this winter, which are being investigated by the police.

## Ice hockey

Then sports news.

The Finnish men's national ice hockey team advances to the medal games at the Winter Olympics.

The Lions defeated Switzerland 3-2 in overtime last night and will now play in the semifinals.

The semi-finals will be played tomorrow. Finland and Canada will face off, as well as the USA and Slovakia.

The winners of the matches will play for the gold medal and the losers for the bronze medal.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow the sun will shine in almost the entire country. It will be cloudy on the eastern border.

The weather will warm up slightly in the south and west.
