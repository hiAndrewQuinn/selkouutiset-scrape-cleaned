Ministerio. Wolt food delivery. Winter holidays. Weather.

## Ministerial resignation

First, domestic politics.

The Minister of Social Affairs and Health is changing.

**Kaisa Juuso** of the Finns Party is leaving her job as Minister of Social Affairs and Health.

Juuso says in the press release that the minister's work has been difficult, and he has had to make difficult decisions.

During Juuso's tenure as minister, the government has made major cuts to social and health services.

The Minister of Social Affairs and Health will be replaced. The chairman of the Finns Party, **Riikka Purra**, says that a new Minister of Social Affairs and Health will be elected as soon as possible.

## Wolt food delivery people

Then we'll talk about food parcels.

The Wolt food delivery service has hired its first food delivery workers. This means that the delivery workers are now Wolt employees, whereas until now they have been entrepreneurs.

The employment contract states that the food delivery person can decide their own working hours. The delivery person does not receive a salary for waiting for orders. Wolt only pays the delivery person for the time spent delivering food orders. The delivery person must use their own vehicle and phone for work.

Wolt has hired its first food delivery drivers. Wolt plans to hire a total of one hundred delivery drivers by the end of March.

Most food parcels still work as entrepreneurs.

## Winter holidays

Then the topic is winter holidays.

The school children's winter holidays are about to begin.

Schools in Southern Finland are on holiday next week. After that, schoolchildren in Central Finland, for example, will be on holiday. Finally, it is the turn of Northern and Eastern Finland.

The winter holidays are about to begin.

Many people go on vacation to northern ski resorts.

There may be a lot of holiday traffic on the roads today and this weekend. There will also be a lot of passengers on trains in the north.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather tomorrow will be sunny and cold throughout the country. Only in Northern Ostrobothnia will there be more cloud cover.

It's 10...20 degrees below zero. In Lapland it can be as low as 30 degrees below zero.
