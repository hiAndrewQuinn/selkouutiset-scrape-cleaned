The EU Parliament and Hungary. Hyperspectral satellite. Helmets. Weather.

## EU Parliament and Hungary

First, about European Union policy.

The EU Parliament has started a new term. There are 15 MEPs from Finland, i.e. members of the parliament.

Yle asked Finnish MPs whether Hungary's presidency should be suspended. 12 MEPs answered yes.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has made so-called peace trips to Russia and China. Orbán has appeared on trips as a representative of the EU.

The European Parliament has started a new term. Many Finnish MEPs said that Hungary's presidency should have been canceled even before it started.

Each EU country holds the presidency for half a year.

## Finnish space technology

Now the science news.

A Finnish technology company launches a small satellite into space, which images the Earth with hyperspectral cameras. They can be used to describe the density and changes of materials.

Cameras can also be used to obtain new information about changes in the environment, such as the growth of fields or forests.

Director of Technology Tuomas Tikka from the Kuva Space company says that with a hundred satellites, for example, the entire Earth can be photographed once a day.

Hyperspectral technology has been developed in the VTT research laboratory in Otaniemi, Espoo, which is owned by the Finnish state.

With the hyperspectral filter, you get a hundred different colors in the image that the human eye cannot see. Images are examined with the help of artificial intelligence.

A Finnish company starts photographing the Earth from space with hyperspectral cameras.

They can also be used to monitor the border areas of countries. That is why the technology is of interest to, for example, the defense alliance NATO.

## Helmets

More sports.

The Finnish women's national football team Helmarit lost to Italy in the evening. Italy beat Finland 4 - 0.

Helmarit did not make it to the European championships next summer, at least not yet. The game was the last game of the qualifying group.

The possibility of a place in the competition is still in October in the further qualifications.

## Weather

Finally, the weather forecast.

It rains a lot and thunders in the middle and east of the country. There will also be showers in the west. The temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees.

In rainy areas, it can be a little cooler for a while.
