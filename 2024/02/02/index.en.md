Today, Friday, the strikes are disrupting traffic.

Strikes are political. Workers' organizations are protesting against the government's plans with strikes.

## Construction students

Then news from the construction industry.

There are not enough internships for construction students.

The construction industry is doing badly right now. Many construction companies have had to stop operating.

Therefore, it is difficult for students in the field to find internships.

Tampere region's vocational school Tredu now builds houses itself. In this way, it ensures that students get to practice working in their own field.

Here, the students build a house with Nokia. One of them is **Arttu Nurminen**, who is already waiting to enter working life.

*- I'm really excited about going to work, but then we'll see how easy it is to find those jobs when it's not the best situation, but can't you figure something out after all.*

## Glass blowing

Finally, culture.

There are few glassblowers left.

Here, glassblower **Jaska Liikanen** is at work. Liikanen has been in the industry for almost 60 years.

This time, Liikanen realizes a work designed by glass artist **Camilla Moberg**.

The work is difficult. There are only 3 glassblowers in Finland who are able to realize Moberg's works.

There are few glassblowers left.

In December, the UN cultural organization Unesco decided that glassblowing will enter the list of cultural heritage.

Finland proposed the issue together with 5 other countries.

In Finland too, it is now hoped that the recognition will increase the popularity of the industry.
