Initially, the topic is Greenland.

The US has made new threats in an attempt to gain control of the island of Greenland.

The US is threatening many European countries with new import tariffs starting in early February. President Trump says the tariffs will remain in place until the US is allowed to buy Greenland.

The threat affects 8 European countries, including Finland.

Greenland is a self-governing territory and part of Denmark. Denmark and Greenland have both said that Greenland is not for sale.

## Iranian protests

Then we'll talk about the protests in Iran.

Thousands of people have died in protests in Iran.

The death toll is at least 3,500, says the Norwegian-based human rights group IHR. In addition, at least 18,000 people have been imprisoned.

However, Iran has cut off its connections with the rest of the world, so it is difficult to get information about what is really happening in the country.

## Social security for immigrants

Now domestic news about the government's new legislative project.

The government plans to cut social security for immigrants based on language skills.

The government proposes that unemployed immigrants receive either integration support or general support, depending on how long they have lived and worked in Finland. Integration support is 80 euros less than general support.

If an immigrant knows Finnish or Swedish well enough, he or she will be paid a language supplement. In that case, the integration allowance is equal to the general allowance.

## The ability of Finns to function

Then the topic is the poor health of the Finns.

The functional capacity of Finns has weakened, according to a new study by the UKK Institute.

People are carrying more weight and are moving and sleeping less than before.

Finland's new goal is to improve people's functional capacity.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo proposes that the use of social media be banned for those under the age of 15. This would leave children and young people more time for exercise and other hobbies.

## Darkness
