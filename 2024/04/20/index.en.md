Savings of the Finnish economy.

The topic of the news week is savings in the Finnish economy.

There are problems in the Finnish economy. Finland has too much spending and too little income. Almost all parties say so.

Finland takes on too much debt.

The government now intends to improve the situation of the Finnish economy. It has a big impact on many people's lives.

We will tell you more about it next.

## Smaller subsidies

The government decided in the negotiations at the beginning of the week to reduce Finland's government spending.

The government plans to spend less money on, for example, various subsidies. Subsidies usually go to people with little money.

For example, the state pays part of their rent. The state also gives money to, for example, the unemployed and students.

Therefore, many students and unemployed people will have less money in the future.

The state also pays a smaller part of the rent for poor people.

## Other savings

The government plans to reduce government spending in many areas. It affects the lives of many Finns.

For example, hospitals receive less money than before.

In some hospitals, women can no longer give birth. Some hospitals are closed at night.

Vocational schools, for example, also receive less money than before.

## Taxes will be increased

The government also wants the state to get more income. That's why the government increases taxes on pensions a little.

The government also increases, for example, value added tax. Now we explain what VAT is.

A part of the price of almost all goods and services is VAT.

Therefore, a person pays VAT almost every time he buys something.

When VAT rises, prices rise.

In the future, Finland will have almost the largest value added tax in Europe.

Therefore, goods and services will soon become somewhat more expensive.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week has been savings in the state economy.

The government plans to save state money in many matters. Therefore, many supports and services are deteriorating.

The government also wants more income for the state. That's why the government raises taxes.

The government says that without savings, Finland will take on too much debt.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
