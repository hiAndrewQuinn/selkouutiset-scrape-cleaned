Baltic Sea cables. Employment services. Blood donation. Weather.

## Baltic Sea cables

First, news from the Baltic Sea.

NATO is sending ships to the Baltic Sea to monitor important cables on the seabed. NATO is sending about 10 ships to the Baltic Sea.

For example, electricity and telecommunications cables run on the seabed.

There have been many cable failures in the Baltic Sea in a short period of time. That is why Finland and Estonia have asked NATO for monitoring assistance.

The latest cable damage occurred on Christmas Day. It is suspected to have been caused by the tanker Eagle S.

It may have broken the cables by dragging the anchor on the seabed.

## Employment services

Then the topic is employment services.

Employment services were reformed at the turn of the year. They were transferred from the state's employment and training offices to the responsibility of municipalities.

The reform affects nearly 300,000 unemployed job seekers across the country.

The goal of the reform is to create 10,000 new jobs.

Employment services are now the responsibility of municipalities.

For example, the city of Vantaa is starting targeted training for the unemployed. Vantaa plans to train up to 1,000 unemployed people in various fields during the year.

## Blood donation

Then the topic is blood donation.

More blood donors are needed.

Today, approximately 3 percent of Finnish adults donate blood annually.

However, the number of blood donors is constantly decreasing because new donors are not coming in at the same rate as old ones are leaving.

The Finnish Red Cross Blood Service says that 20,000 new blood donors are needed every year.

Blood is needed for blood products, which hospitals use, for example, in surgeries.

Jarkko Kärkkäinen has been donating blood for 20 years.

\- It feels good to be able to help.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

Scattered snowfall or rain will occur in the southern part of the country. Elsewhere, there will be light rain.

In the south, the temperature is between 0 and +2 degrees, in the central and northern parts of the country between -7 and -25 degrees.
