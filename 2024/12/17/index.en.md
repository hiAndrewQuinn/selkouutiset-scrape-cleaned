Hospital night shifts. Lucia and racism. Harmonica players. Wednesday's weather.

## Hospital night shifts

First, news about hospitals.

Night shifts at hospitals are decreasing.

Parliament today passed a law that will close night duty in many hospitals.

Night duty will end in, for example, Salo, Iisalmi, Varkaus, Jämsä and Raahe.

The government's bill received a lot of criticism from different parts of Finland.

Night shifts at hospitals are decreasing.

The Parliament approved the government's bill with only a small majority of votes.

Even some members of parliament from the ruling parties voted against the law.

## Lucia and racism

Then the topic is Lucia and racism.

This year's Lucia is being targeted by racism.

For example, there are a lot of racist comments about Lucia on social media.

This year's Lucia is **Daniela Owusu**. Owusu is Finland's first brown Lucia. Owusu's father is from Ghana.

Owusu was crowned Lucia last Friday. She now performs in various places, including nursing homes.

Due to racist messages, Lucia's appearances are now protected more closely than before.

This year's Lucia is being targeted by racism.

Equality Ombudsman **Kristina Stenman** says that many people still have a very one-sided perception of Finnishness.

Now, a backlash has also begun on social media. Many are sharing a message urging people to participate in the Lucia fundraiser.

The Lucia fundraiser raises money for poor families with children.

## Harmonica players

Then the topic is music.

Music unites people.

These men play the harmonica.

They rehearse and perform together.

Men are like one family.

The average age of the band members is 82 years.

Age is no barrier to playing the harmonica. It can always be done.
