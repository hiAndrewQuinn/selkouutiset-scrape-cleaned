## Sensitive information

The data breach was carried out in the systems of education and training. This branch handles the affairs of schools and students.

The burglar took, for example, students' and guardians' personal identification numbers and the information of city employees. Some of the information was sensitive. Sensitive information includes, for example, information about children who need special education or doctor's statements.

Almost 120,000 people's information was taken in the data breach. The hacker obtained the information of approximately 38,000 employees and the information of approximately 80,000 learners or guardians.

## Remote management server

The data breach in Helsinki was noticed on May Day eve, i.e. April 30. The intruder gained access to the information network of the city of Helsinki via a remote management server.

Remote management servers are needed so that employees can use the systems remotely. Remote management servers may have vulnerabilities. That is why remote management servers are of interest to criminals.

For example, the remote management server of the city of Helsinki was missing an update to fix the vulnerability. That's why the intruder used his own computer to access the Helsinki system via a remote management server.

## Police investigation
