Worrying information has been reported this week about children being overweight. About 25 percent of boys and about 20 percent of girls were overweight or obese last year. The information is from a new report by the Institute of Health and Welfare, or THL.

Overweight in children has been increasing for a long time. Overweight in children is now 2 or even 3 times more common than a few decades ago.

Being overweight is often one of the causes of cardiovascular diseases. That's why it's worrying if overweight starts in childhood, says THL's development manager Päivi Mäki.

## There are many reasons for being overweight

Researchers say that the biggest reason for children being overweight is the food environment. Nowadays, delicacies that make you fat are sold everywhere.

There are differences in children's overweight between different regions of Finland. The least overweight children are in Helsinki. There is more overweight in rural areas.

One of the reasons for this may be that in rural areas the journeys to school are often so long that children cannot go to school by bike or on foot.

It is more common for boys to be overweight than for girls. THL's Päivi Mäki says that it can also be caused by hormones.

## Being overweight can be prevented

Researchers say that overweight in children can be prevented. It is important that the family eats together and that mealtimes are regular.

Päivi Mäki also says that advertising unhealthy food should not be as easy as it is now. He hopes that the food packages clearly state how healthy or unhealthy the food is.

Children's overweight can also be prevented by exercise. That's why Mäki hopes for more exercise in kindergartens and schools.

Mäki reminds us that we need to talk about children's overweight without blaming the children. Health and well-being are happy things.

## Repeat

Children's overweight has increased.
