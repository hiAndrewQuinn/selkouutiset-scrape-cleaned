Finland closes many border crossings on the eastern border.

The government decided that the border stations of Imatra, Niirala, Nuijamaa and Vaalimaa will be closed on the night between Friday and Saturday. After this, no traffic passes through these border stations. Border stations are closed at least until mid-February.

On the eastern border, only the Vartius, Salla, Kuusamo and Raja-Joosepi border crossings will be open from Saturday.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo says that Finland wants to ensure border security. That's why the border stations are closed.

During the fall, more asylum seekers than usual have arrived at the border crossing points in Southeast Finland. Asylum seekers came from many countries to the Finnish border via Russia. They did not have the papers with them, which are needed when coming to Finland from Russia.

### Unemployment

The number of unemployed people will increase in Finland this year. This is what the Ministry of Labor estimates.

The ministry says that there will soon be the same number of laid-off people as in 2009. At the beginning of next year, there will be almost 40,000 laid-off workers. Lay-off means that a person will be unemployed for a period of, for example, 3 months or 6 months.

The Ministry of Labor estimates that the Finnish economy will improve in 2025. There were also more jobs then than now.

### Dödspatrullen trial

A trial related to the Swedish Dödspatrullen gang began in Helsinki.

27 people are accused in the district court. The prosecutor demands imprisonment for almost all the accused. 9 of the accused are Finnish citizens and 7 are Swedish citizens. The rest of the accused are citizens of other countries.

The court deals with drug crimes. The police say that a Swedish street gang tried to take over the Finnish drug market. Dödspatrullen is a violent Swedish street gang that commits a lot of drug crimes.
