In Finland, we all choose the decision-makers together. So Finland is a democratic country.

The president is elected every 6 years. This time there are 9 candidates. The candidates are 6 men and 3 women.

Candidates are candidates of parties or voter associations.

Ordinary people can form a voter association to support a candidate in the presidential election.

The presidential candidates travel around Finland. All the candidates want to tell people why he will be a good president.

In Finland, all adults can vote in presidential elections.

However, no one needs to tell others who to vote for. There is an election secret in Finland.

Voting at polling stations is easy.

More instructions can be found in the plain-language brochure that the Ministry of Justice has made with Selkokeskus.
