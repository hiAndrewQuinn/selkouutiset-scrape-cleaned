## PEth test

The PEth test has been introduced in occupational health inspections. The test is performed on a blood sample.

The PEth test tells you whether a person has consumed a lot of alcohol in the previous weeks.

Heavy and prolonged alcohol use can show up in the test up to 4 weeks later.

Tests have been conducted in the construction and transportation industries, for example. Tests have also been conducted in office work.

## Employee organizations

Alcohol testing has surprised people. People have gone for a workplace health check, but they didn't know that a blood sample is also tested for alcohol use.

That is why labor organizations are concerned about this issue.

The Finnish Confederation of Trade Unions (SAK) has been notified of dozens of cases in which employees only found out about the test afterwards.

The matter has been resolved after the employee was sanctioned due to the test result.

A person's work has been suspended and even their wages have been stopped due to heavy alcohol consumption.

The Automotive and Transport Workers' Association (AKT) also says that alcohol tests have led to, for example, a driving ban or unpaid leave or even dismissal.

## Basics

The employers' organization EK defends alcohol tests.

EK's medical expert **Auli Rytivaara** says that alcohol testing is an important way to prevent accidents.

The test helps identify situations where an employee's health may not be sufficient for safe work.

For example, the health of professional drivers must be checked regularly.

Rytivaara says that alcohol tests should not be performed on people randomly.

Tests should be part of regular occupational health monitoring.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was workplace alcohol tests, or PEth tests.

In Finland, occupational health inspections have begun to examine people's alcohol consumption during leisure time.

There are tests in the construction and transportation sectors, for example. The rationale is that the tests increase occupational safety.

Employee organizations are concerned about the situation because it is new and surprising.
