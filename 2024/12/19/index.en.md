Electric cars. Heikki Silvennoinen. Christmas traditions. Christmas traffic. Weather.

## Electric cars

First, the topic of electric cars.

An electric car should last as long as a petrol car. This is the opinion of the Consumer Disputes Board, which handles commercial disputes.

The number of electric cars is growing in Finland. There are also more used electric cars for sale than before.

That is why disputes between buyers and sellers of electric cars are also increasing, the Consumer Disputes Board estimates.

The Consumer Disputes Board believes that an electric car should last as long as a gasoline car.

That means the car will last 300,000 kilometers.

## Heikki Silvennoinen

Then the sad news.

Actor and musician **Heikki Silvennoinen** died yesterday at the age of 70.

Silvennoinen starred, for example, in the comedy show Kummeli.

A special broadcast will be broadcast on TV1 today, Thursday, remembering Heikki Silvento. The program starts at 7 p.m.

## Christmas traditions

Then the topic is Christmas traditions.

Christmas traditions are important to Finns.

Christmas traditions bring a sense of belonging. They also give a sense of security. This is what researcher **Blanka Henriksson** says.

Here are Finns at the Christmas market. They say that the Christmas traditions that are important to them are gingerbread, the Christmas tree, Christmas flowers, and the Christmas Peace Declaration.

Christmas traditions are important to Finns.

That's why they're also a sensitive issue. If someone wants to change Christmas traditions, many of us get nervous.

Then we ask what else we have in common, says Blanka Henriksson.

## Christmas traffic

Then news about traffic.

Christmas traffic starts tonight. This is what Fintraffic's traffic center estimates.

Many people are leaving for Christmas today, but there will be a lot of traffic throughout the weekend.

Many people return from Christmas celebrations on Boxing Day, which is Thursday next week.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will snow in the north. It will also rain intermittently elsewhere. In the south it will rain sleet or water.

It's above zero in the south. It's freezing in the west and north. The wind makes the weather feel colder.
