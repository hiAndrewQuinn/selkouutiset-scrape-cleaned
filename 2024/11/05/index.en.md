Family background and education. Relationships of Finns. A new ballet performance. Wednesday's weather.

## Family background and education

First, the topic is education.

Family background affects a young person's education.

This is what the Institute of Health and Welfare says.

A young person is more likely to go to high school and university if the young person's parents have a good education.

Parents' education does not have as much influence on a young person who wants vocational training.

Family background is important when a young person chooses a place of study.

**Linda Andersson** is 36 years old. He is studying at university now.

Andersson's parents do not have a university education. That's one of the reasons he didn't apply to college sooner.

## Relationships of Finns

Then the topic is a relationship.

Marriage is important to Finns.

The majority of Finns want a relationship, and about 70 percent of Finns live in a relationship.

This is what Väestöliitto's report says.

Those Finns who live in a relationship are especially satisfied with life. They also get sick less than those who are not in a relationship.

**Anna** and **Kari Ålander** have been married for 45 years. "It's good this way," they say.

Marriage is important to Finns.

Finnish couples usually have sex about once a week.

## New ballet performance

Then the topic is ballet.

The Finnish National Ballet has a new performance.

In November, you can see a performance called Death in Venice at the National Ballet.

The story is from a book by the German **Thomas Mann**, which appeared more than 100 years ago. In the story, an old writer becomes interested in young Tadzio.

The ballet performance tells how love changes a person.

Death in Venice is a new performance by the Finnish National Ballet.

The famous American dance artist **John Neumeier** has designed the dances for the show.

Finnish **Atte Kilpinen** will be seen in the role of Tadzio. He has danced the role of Tadzio before in Hamburg.
