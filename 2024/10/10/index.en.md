## Labor market model

First, news about politics.

The opposition criticizes the government's labor market model.

The government is preparing an export-led labor market model. It means that export industries determine the general level of wage increases.

Parliament discussed the matter on Wednesday.

The opposition says that the export-driven model is bad for, for example, nurses and other fields with a lot of women.

Salaries in female-dominated fields are low. They cannot be increased enough if the export industry determines the general increase percentage. Then the small wages always rise only a little.

The opposition criticizes the government's labor market model.

The government defends the model. The government says that an export-led labor market model helps Finland's competitiveness.

## Electricity grid

Now news about electricity.

Demand for electricity is growing rapidly. Industry, heating and electric car charging need more electricity.

This charging station for electric cars has large batteries. The batteries are filled with a slow electric current. The batteries quickly provide a lot of power for charging electric cars.

There will probably be batteries for other charging stations as well. Batteries are needed because the electricity grid cannot transport electricity fast enough.

The situation is difficult for companies and cities. Companies cannot establish new factories in some locations.

Demand for electricity is growing rapidly.

Renewing the electricity network is expensive and slow.

Here, a battery electricity storage is being built in a residential area in Espoo.
