Competitiveness Social media. Egrets. Weather.

## Competitiveness

First, economic news.

Finland's competitiveness is improving slowly.

In the new competitiveness comparison, Finland ranks 14th.

That's just a notch better than in the previous comparison last year.

Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and Denmark are now at the top of the comparison.

Finland's competitiveness is improving slowly.

It is being held back by the weak economic development of recent years.

The comparison by the Swiss IMD Institute included approximately 70 countries.

## Young people and social media

Then the topic is social media.

MPs disagree on whether young people's use of social media should be restricted.

Yle asked MPs about the matter.

Some support a strict ban on social media. Others say that the ban is impossible to enforce.

In many EU countries, the age limit for social media is 16 years.

In Finland, the age limit is 13. However, in Finland, up to 90 percent of 10-year-old children use social media.

Children and young people's phone use in schools will be restricted starting in the autumn.

## Eiders

Then we will talk about the eider, which is an endangered bird species.

The number of eiders has decreased rapidly.

In Hanko, the Tvärminne Zoological Station has been studying eiders for over 30 years. During that time, the eider population has shrunk by a third.

The eider has more enemies in nature than before. They are preyed upon by white-tailed eagles, minks and raccoon dogs, says Kim Jaatinen, a specialist researcher at the Finnish Environment Institute.

There are already so few eiders that the species is highly endangered.

Researchers in Tvärminne are now investigating how eiders adapt to a stressful environment. The birds' stress levels can be seen in a blood test.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow the sun will shine almost all over the country.

The temperature in the south is up to 23 degrees Celsius. In the north, the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius.
