GNSS jamming. Russia sanctions. Coffee hoarding. Weather.

## GNSS interference

Initially, the topic is satellite positioning.

Satellite positioning jamming, or GNSS jamming, has increased in Finland in recent years.

The disruption is detrimental to, for example, air and maritime traffic.

Satellite positioning allows planes and ships to know exactly where they are and where they are going.

A study by the National Land Survey of Finland shows that GNSS interference has increased, and it is especially common in Eastern Finland.

The harassment originates from Russia.

## Russia sanctions

Then the news about Russia sanctions.

Finland and Sweden want new economic sanctions on Russia.

Finland and Sweden want Russian fertilizers, for example, to no longer be imported into the EU.

They also want the export of European luxury goods to Russia to stop.

In addition, the countries propose a ban on ships carrying Russian oil, gas or coal from operating in EU ports.

Finland and Sweden want to tighten sanctions on Russia.

The foreign ministers of Finland and Sweden announced the matter at a security meeting in Sälen, Sweden.

## Coffee hoarding

Finally, let's talk about coffee.

Finns are hoarding more coffee than before.

Hoarding means buying many packages of coffee to stock up when there is a good offer in the store.

For example, S Group stores sold about 20 percent more coffee on sale in December than a year earlier. K Group stores have also noticed that coffee offers are of interest to customers.

People are hoarding discount coffee because the price of coffee has risen a lot, and their own financial situation may have tightened.

Rita Vikman and Hannu Herlevi tell us how much coffee they have hoarded.

\- Dare I say it? I probably have 18 packages.

\- There are probably about a dozen packages on the top shelves of the upper cabinets.

How long will they last?

\- Yeah, maybe a month or two. I use quite a lot of coffee.

## Wednesday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is mainly dry, meaning there is no rain. There is a lot of cloud cover.

The temperature is between 5 degrees in the south and 25 degrees in the north.
