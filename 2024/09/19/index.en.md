Income support. NATO headquarters. Playgrounds. Friday weather.

## Income support

First, the topic of income support.

A child's bank account can reduce the family's income support.

People can apply for income support from Kela if they otherwise don't have enough money to live on.

When Kela makes a decision about income support, it takes into account all the family's money.

Even a small amount of money in a child's account can reduce the income support.

Yle reports that an amount of 100-200 euros can affect the income support.

It could be, for example, a monetary gift that the child has received.

The child's money can therefore reduce the income support of the whole family.

Elina Pekkarinen, Commissioner for Children's Affairs, thinks it is not right.

## NATO staffs

Then the topic is the defense alliance NATO.

There are plans to establish 2 NATO headquarters in Finland.

One headquarters is planned to be established in Eastern Finland and the other in Lapland. The locations will be clear soon.

Yle's information says that the staffs will probably come to Mikkeli and maybe Rovaniemi or Sodankyl√§.

There are plans to establish 2 NATO headquarters in Finland.

Staffs can strengthen Finland's defense.

The purpose is that NATO troops can train in Finland and come to defend Finland in a crisis situation.

The staffs are part of the measures by which Finland can join NATO's structures. Finland became a member of NATO last year.

## Playgrounds

Then the topic of playgrounds.

City playgrounds are safe. Their safety is monitored.

Jukka Intonen inspects playgrounds in Turku.

He makes sure that the gates and fences of the playground are in order.

In addition, he tests, for example, that the cord of the hoodie does not catch on the devices.

City playgrounds are safe.

However, the playground must be challenging so that the child learns new skills.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will rain, meaning it won't rain.

The sun shines in the southern and central parts of the country. It is partly cloudy in the north.

The temperature is 20 degrees in the south. It's less than ten degrees in the north.
