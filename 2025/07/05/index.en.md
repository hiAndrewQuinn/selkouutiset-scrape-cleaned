## Social Democratic Party

Yle's new party support survey was conducted in June.

The most popular party is still the Social Democratic Party (SDP), supported by around 25 percent of Finns.

Support for the SDP is as high as in the previous survey in May.

The SDP is an opposition party, meaning it is not in the government.

The SDP's lead over the Coalition Party has increased slightly, as the Coalition Party's support has decreased slightly.

## Coalition Party

The second most popular party is the National Coalition Party.

The National Coalition Party's support is almost 21 percent.

The support for the National Coalition Party has decreased slightly. However, the decrease is small.

One reason for the decline is that some of the National Coalition Party's voters in the last election do not yet know which party they will support in the next election.

The National Coalition Party is the governing party and the Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** is also from the National Coalition Party.
