Regional elections will be held in April. Regional elections will be held in the welfare regions, of which there are 21 in Finland.

Municipalities and cities belong to welfare areas. One area can include many municipalities. For example, the Lapland welfare area has 21 municipalities.

Regional councils are elected in regional elections. They decide on the welfare area's affairs and how money is spent.

## Social services and rescue services

Regional elections are important because there are many tasks in the welfare region. These include social services and health services such as nursing care, health centers, and care for the elderly.

Welfare areas decide, for example, how many health centers are needed in the area and where they are located.

The area is also responsible for rescue services, i.e. fire brigades and ambulances.

All the money for welfare areas comes from the state.

This year, the state will provide a total of approximately 26 billion euros to the regions. That is almost 30 percent of this year's state budget.

## Helsinki is an exception

In regional elections, members are elected to the regional council for a term of 4 years.

In elections, people vote for their region's candidate. Candidates are nominated by parties and voter associations.

However, there is one municipality in Finland where regional elections are not held. Helsinki is not part of any welfare region. In Helsinki, all matters are decided by the city council.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week this time was the regional elections. Let's recap the most important things.

Regional elections will be held in Finland in April.

Regional elections elect regional councils for welfare areas.

They decide, for example, on health centers and elderly care in their own area.

Many foreigners are also allowed to vote in regional elections.

Tomorrow, Uutisviikko will report on the municipal elections. Stay tuned!
