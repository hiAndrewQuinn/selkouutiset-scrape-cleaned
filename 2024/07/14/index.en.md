So Finns will soon get a new official food recommendation.

In it, the researchers tell what kind of food is healthy and what kind is unhealthy

The previous Food Recommendation is 10 years old.

Today, food scientists have more information about food and health. That's why the new instructions are a little different from the old instructions.

## Less meat

One changed instruction in the new food recommendation concerns meat products. Processed meats include, for example, sausages, sausages, cold meats and bacon.

The new recommendation says that meat products should not be eaten at all.

The reason is that meat products contain a lot of fat, salt and other unhealthy substances.

The new Food Recommendation also says that it is good to eat red meat only 2 or 3 times a week. The old recommendation was not as strict.

Men in particular eat too much red meat.

Red meat increases the risk of intestinal diseases, for example. Red meat production is also bad for the environment.

## Add vegetables

What does the new Dietary Guidelines say about vegetables? It says that it is good to eat almost 1 kilo of vegetables and fruits a day.

In the old recommendation, there were fewer vegetables and fruits.

Finns have long had the problem that they eat too few vegetables, fruits and berries.

## Don't be too harsh

The new Food Recommendation therefore tells what a healthy diet is like.

Unhealthy food increases the risk of many diseases.

The researchers still remind us that there is no need to be too harsh.

You can also eat unhealthy food sometimes. It is important not to eat unhealthy food too often.

## Repeat

This time the topic of the News Week was a new food recommendation. Let's repeat the most important things.

Finns will soon get a new food recommendation.

The food recommendation tells about a healthy diet.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
