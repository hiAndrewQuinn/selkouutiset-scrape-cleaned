## 17,000 euro bill

The Southwest Finland Welfare Region has sent debt collection letters to approximately 26,000 people.

One of them is **Hannu Lahti** from Turku, who received a bill for over 17,000 euros.

Lahti's mother lives in a serviced apartment. Lahti may not have received all of her mother's serviced apartment bills. That's why some of the bills have gone into collection.

Many people wonder why bills are collected through a collection agency even though a regular invoice for the payments has not been sent first.

The collection includes payments that are up to 3 years old without any itemization.

Invoices have also been sent to people who have already died.

## Consumer Authority

The Consumer Authority says that invoices must be clear and invoices must be sent quickly.

Sending invoices shouldn't take months or years.

If the debt collection letter invoice is large, the customer has the right to request payment time.

## Experts

Welfare district leaders say the reason for the old bills is technical problems.

They apologize for the situation and promise that customers will be provided with original invoices and additional information.

Experts criticize the way welfare bills are collected.

Professor **Tuomas Hupli** says that it is not worth paying a large bill if you do not have accurate information about the subject matter of the bill.

Using a collection agency also increases costs and hassle for customers.
