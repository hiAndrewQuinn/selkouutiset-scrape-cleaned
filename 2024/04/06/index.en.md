There have been serious school shootings in Finland before. There are sad cases that Finns don't forget.

There was a school shooting in Rauma in 1989. Then a 14-year-old boy killed 2 schoolmates with a firearm.

There was a shooting incident at the Jokela school center in Tuusula in 2007. An 18-year-old high school boy killed 8 people and shot himself.

The shooting incident at Kauhajoki University of Applied Sciences was in 2008. A 22-year-old male student of the University of Applied Sciences shot 10 people and finally also himself.

In these cases, the shooters were older than the 12-year-old shooter in Vantaa. However, all shooters felt that they were bullied at school.
