## Purra would end the integration allowance

Finally, news about integration funding, which is an important support for immigrants.

Integration funds are paid to municipalities, and the municipalities use the money to support immigrants.

The money is used, for example, for language training.

Now Finance Minister Riikka Purra is proposing that the state no longer pay integration funds to municipalities.

It can weaken the employment of immigrants, says Glenn Gassen, Director of Immigration in Helsinki:

â€“ This means that we have a fairly large customer group in Helsinki who would no longer receive services and whose chances of finding employment would be much weaker.

Integration allowance is an important support for immigrants.

## The weather is changeable

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be variable on Tuesday. There may be rain and thunderstorms in the north and west.

It is quite windy in the central part of the country.

The temperature is 14 - 23 degrees.
