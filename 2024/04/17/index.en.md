## The government's savings in the frame rush

First, about the Finnish economy.

The government has decided on a large savings package for the years 2025 - 2028. About 3 billion euros will come from tax increases and savings, i.e. cuts.

The biggest change is to raise the general value added tax, or VAT, to 25.5 percent. VAT is now 24 percent.

The tax applies to everyone who buys goods and uses services.

The increase does not apply to medicines and food, for example.

The VAT on sweets and chocolate will rise from the current 14% to 25.5%.

The students' general housing allowance ends, and the support comes from the housing supplement of the study allowance. Students fear that the change will reduce support.

In addition, the government saves on vocational training. Getting a second degree is difficult.

The taxation of the largest salaries and pensions will increase. The price of petrol and diesel will rise.

The government is also cutting health care. The guarantee of access to treatment will be extended to 3 months, while it is now 14 days.

Fees for specialized medical care will rise.

Money is deducted from the actual development cooperation and integration.

## Opposition on savings

The government has decided on a big austerity package in the frame rush.

The opposition says that the cuts will make it difficult, especially for low-income earners.

According to the opposition, the government's actions do not help Finland's economic growth.

## Maternity kit

Kela has introduced a new maternity package. It is given to all families with babies.

There are almost 40 products in the maternity package this year.

It is cloudy in the east and south. The sun shines in the west and north.

The temperature is a little on the plus side in the south and west. There is frost in the east and north.
