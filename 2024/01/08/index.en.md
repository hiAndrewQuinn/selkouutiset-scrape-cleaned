## Immigrants

First, news about immigrants.

The employment of immigrants has improved rapidly.

There are also problems with it. Many immigrants have a fixed-term employment contract.

Many work through a temporary agency. Some work in a profession that does not match their education.

Then the news about housing problems.

In Finland, the number of people who are without a home has decreased.

Back in the 1980s, there were 20,000 people without housing in Finland. Now there are about 4,000 of them.

Today, it is often a person without a home who has a substance abuse problem. He may also have mental health issues.

The number of people without housing has decreased in Finland.

Finland is the only EU country where there are fewer of them than before.

One reason is that society can also give an apartment to a person who uses a lot of intoxicants.

The weather is warming up fast now.

The severe frosts are over, and in some parts of Finland the temperature will rise up to 30 degrees in a short time.

It will be so warm in southern Finland in the next few days that the snow and ice will start to melt.

The roads can be very slippery soon. Frozen water pipes can break when the ice expands due to heat.

## Weather forecast

Another weather forecast. It snows a little in Lapland. It also rains a little snow or sleet in the east.

The temperature is on the positive side. It is 10 degrees below zero in Eastern Lapland.
