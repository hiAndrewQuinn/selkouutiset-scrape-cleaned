## Advance voting

First, news about the elections.

Early voting for regional and municipal elections ends today, Tuesday.

The last advance voting locations will close at 8 p.m.

Advance voting locations are located, for example, in shopping centers, libraries, and municipal halls.

Early voting began on Wednesday of last week.

The Ministry of Justice's Director of Elections, **Arto Jääskeläinen**, says that early voting has been quite lively.

About 22 percent of those eligible to vote have already voted in the election. Today, Tuesday, the number is expected to rise further.

Jääskeläinen estimates that the election turnout will rise to over 50 percent.

It is common for regional and municipal elections to interest people less than parliamentary elections.

Early voting for regional and municipal elections ends today.

The actual election day is next Sunday, April 13th.

## Regional and municipal councils

You too.
