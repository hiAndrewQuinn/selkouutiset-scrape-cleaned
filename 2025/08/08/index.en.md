Drought. Joint replacements. Maternity kits. Weather.

## Drought

First, the news about the drought.

Finland is starting to prepare for drought.

The Ministry of Agriculture has made plans for the first time to manage drought risks. The Finnish Environment Institute says that drought warnings can also be issued in Finland.

This vegetable farm in Mikkeli has been fighting drought for a long time. There is a pump on the bank, and the water goes through a pipe to the edge of the field. From there, the water is directed into the field.

Finland is starting to prepare for drought.

For example, there was a drought in 2018. It caused losses of over 400 million euros to agriculture alone.

## Joint replacement surgeries

Now health news.

The lines for joint replacement surgery are long.

For example, in Northern Savo, the waiting list for surgery used to be 16 months at most. Now, surgery can be done in about six months.

The rehabilitation area has purchased surgical services from private healthcare provider Mehil√§inen.

The lines for joint replacement surgery are long.

Efforts are being made to relieve congestion all over Finland.

## Maternity kits

Now about the number of babies.

Fewer babies have been born in Finland this year and last year than expected. That's why Kela is still only distributing last year's maternity packages.

Kela is now considering whether to leave out the year numbers. Some people are disappointed when they don't get the latest packaging.

A maternity package is a grant given to a mother or adoptive mother living in Finland.

This year, there are 36 products in the package.

So few babies have been born that last year's maternity packages are now being distributed.

Maternity allowance was first given to low-income people in 1937. Since 1949, all mothers have received it.

The value of the package can also be taken in cash. It is now 170 euros.

Most mothers choose a maternity kit.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow will be typical summer weather. Sometimes it will rain and sometimes it will be sunny.

There is more sun than rain.

In the north, it will rain a little more and lightning, or thunder, is possible.
