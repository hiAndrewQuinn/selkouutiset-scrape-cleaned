Doctor's appointments. Wolves. Yle bus. Weather.

## Doctor's appointments

First, some news about healthcare.

Many people make an appointment with a doctor but don't go to the doctor. The doctor waits in vain for the patient if the patient hasn't canceled the appointment. That's expensive for welfare areas.

Welfare areas are losing millions of euros because people are not canceling doctor's appointments. The money is people's common tax money.

In Kouvola, Juha Rantakauliota is surprised that doctors' appointments are not being used:

*–That's shocking. There will be unreasonable costs.*

*–A little over 2 million. How does that sound?*

*–Huh, huh. There would be better uses for the money.*

## Wolves

Next we will talk about wolves.

Wolves often visit the yards of some houses. This year wolves have visited the yards of houses 4,000 times. Last year wolves visited yards less.

In South Ostrobothnia, in Isossakyrö, a wolf visits the farm yard almost every day.

Juulia Piippo has a horse on the farm that is afraid of wolves. The horse is stressed and restless. Piippo is worried because the horse is pregnant.

Piippo would like the wolf to be killed or banished. It is difficult to get permission for this because the wolf is protected.

Wolves often visit the yards of some houses.

## Yle bus

Finally, we will talk about the Yle bus.

Yle has its own bus that people can visit. The Yle 100 bus runs all over Finland.

Yle wants to meet people because Yle will be 100 years old next year.

There is a lot of stuff on the bus. For example, there are clothes from famous people, such as singer Käärijä's famous green outfit.

People can visit Yle's own bus in different cities.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will be rainy on Thursday. It may rain almost throughout the country.

The temperature is around 15 degrees. In the east it can be over 20 degrees.
