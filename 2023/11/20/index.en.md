Russia can direct more and more asylum seekers to the Finnish border. This is what the Polish professor **Maciej Duszczyc** warns.

The professor says that Finland must prepare for a difficult situation on the eastern border, i.e. the border between Finland and Russia.

In Europe, for example, 100 asylum seekers a day come from the east to the Polish border.

On Monday afternoon, asylum seekers came to the Salla border station in Northern Finland, which is open.

The asylum seekers were Syrian and Afghan men, women and children.

At the weekend, Finland closed four border crossings because Russia has started directing asylum seekers to the border.

Researchers say that this is how Russia wants to create disorder in Finland.

During November, more than 500 asylum seekers have come to Finland through the eastern border.

### Price of electricity

The price of electricity will go up a lot on Tuesday. Especially on Tuesday afternoon, electricity is expensive. The price will stay high for a while.

There are at least two reasons for the high price of electricity. The first is that the weather is calm and the wind turbines produce little electricity

Another reason is that the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant had a fault on Sunday. Due to the fault, the nuclear power plant produces less electricity than normal.

Attempts are being made to quickly fix the problem at the nuclear power plant. The nuclear power plant will probably be operating normally already on Tuesday.

### Kindergartens

Many immigrants work in daycare centers these days. Many of them are just learning the Finnish language

There are many open jobs in daycare centers because there are not enough employees.

More workers are needed in kindergartens across Finland.

Kindergarten teachers say that in kindergarten you have to have a fairly good command of the Finnish language. Without language skills, it is difficult to work with children.
