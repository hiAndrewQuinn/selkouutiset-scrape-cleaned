The US President's Peace Council met for the first time this week. Donald Trump has established a council that was supposed to only concern the Palestinian territory of Gaza.

Trump said at the meeting that the US would provide $10 billion for the reconstruction of Gaza.

At least 27 countries have accepted an invitation to Trump's council. From Europe, only Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania and Kosovo are included.

Trump is the council's chairman for life.

He has suggested that the Council could replace the United Nations, or UN, in other world conflicts.

5 people have died in nursing homes this winter.

Nurses say the deaths were not a surprise.

More than 50 elderly care workers told Yle about their experiences. The workers said that dangerous situations have increased. Most of them still go unreported.

The Super union receives reports of dangerous situations almost every day. Nurses say the reason is the reduction in nurse quotas.

The law determines how many caregivers there must be in a nursing home.

A record low number of apartments are being built this year. Experts tell Yle that too many apartments are still being built.

There is already more housing than is needed in large cities. Even though the population is growing, the economic situation is poor and people live closer together than before.

Many new buildings have many empty apartments.

The Al-Hol camp in Syria has been closed.

At the beginning of the year, there were still about 10 Finns in the camp, most of whom were children.

Jussi Tanner, Head of Consular Affairs at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, says he cannot provide an accurate account of the situation of Finns.

The camp has housed the wives and children of fighters from the terrorist organization ISIS.
