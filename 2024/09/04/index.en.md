Budget. Taxes and savings. Bishop's medal. Thursday's weather.

## The budget is ready

First, news about government money.

The government has told what the financial situation of the Finnish state will be next year.

The government presented next year's budget yesterday. In the budget, the government has planned the income and expenditure of the state for the next year.

Next year, the Finnish government will receive about 77 billion euros in revenue, but there will be much more expenses. The state spends about 89 billion euros.

The state is therefore forced to take on a new debt of more than 12 billion euros.

So the government has told what the financial situation of the Finnish state will be next year.

Finance Minister Riikka Purra says that the money goes especially to social and health services. One of the reasons for this is that the number of elderly people is increasing.

## Taxes and savings

Let's continue with the state's financial situation.

The government wants the growth of Finland's debt to stop. That is why the government raises taxes and makes savings.

This can be seen in big and small things. For example, the prices of candies and sweets will rise when their tax increases next year.

Ordering cleaning and care work at home is also more expensive. The invoice from home work will reduce the customer's taxes less next year than now.

The state receives savings when, for example, the government reduces money for vocational training. However, the government promises that no savings will be made for the undergraduate education of young people.

The government wants the growth of Finland's debt to stop.

However, the government gives more money, especially for security. That's why the army and the police get more money.

## Silver medal for Piispa

Then sports.

Here is Finland's first medal from the Paris Paralympics.

Toni Piispanen got a silver medal in track winding yesterday. He was second in the 200 meters.

Piispanen's silver is Finland's first medal at the Paris Paralympics.

The Paralympics continue until Sunday.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

There will be showers in Lapland. Elsewhere it is cloudy and sunny.

The temperature is around 25 degrees in the southern and central parts of the country. In Lapland, the temperature remains below 20 degrees.
