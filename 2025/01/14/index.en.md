## NATO meeting of the Baltic Sea countries

First, news about security policy.

A NATO meeting for the Baltic Sea region was held in Finland today.

The leaders of the Baltic Sea NATO countries gathered in Helsinki.

The meeting was hosted by President **Alexander Stub** and Estonian Prime Minister **Kristen Michal**.

The topic of the meeting was the security situation in the Baltic Sea.

The security situation is worrying because telecommunications and electricity cables have been damaged in the Baltic Sea.

The Russian shadow fleet is also a concern for the Baltic Sea countries. The shadow fleet refers to foreign tankers that export Russian oil abroad.

Many shadow ships are in poor condition. Finland has stopped a shadow ship that may have broken cables in the Baltic Sea.

## Elderly care services

Now news about elderly care.

Welfare regions are looking for big savings in services for the elderly. The regions' goal is to save around 140 million euros this year.

Some regions want to reduce the placement of elderly people in nursing homes.

Scientists say that's a bad thing.

The number of home care visits has decreased. There are over 2,200 elderly people waiting for 24-hour care.

Welfare areas are looking for big savings in services for the elderly.

There are a lot of people at home who need help but don't get it.

This is what Professor **Teppo Gröger** of the University of Jyväskylä says:

*"The situation is already really weak and worrying at the moment. It seems like we already have a lot of people at home who are not getting the help they need."*

## The visually impaired and winter

Finally, a word about the visually impaired and winter.

Snow makes it difficult for the visually impaired to move around.

**Paulina Hannus** lives in Porvoo.

He has been blind since birth.

Hannus can move well, but snow changes the city. For example, sounds become muffled when there is a lot of soft snow.

Usually Hannus follows the edge of the street with a white stick. In winter, the edges of the street disappear under a wall of snow.

You may also encounter a pile of snow on the sidewalk. It can lead a visually impaired person in the wrong direction.

Snow makes it difficult for the visually impaired to move around.

However, Paulina Hannus likes to be outdoors.

## Wednesday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Wednesday it will be sunny in the east in the afternoon.

It will rain in Northern Finland in the evening.

The temperature is between +1 and -8 degrees.
