Homeless. Finnair. Daycare. Weather.

## Homeless

Initially, the topic is the homeless, i.e. people who do not have their own home.

The number of homeless people in Finland is increasing.

The number of homeless people started to increase last year. Preliminary data indicates that the increase will continue this year as well.

The homeless population is increasingly made up of families with children and people who work. Statistics show that there were over a hundred homeless families last year.

Experts say government cuts are increasing the number of homeless people.

Today is Homeless Night.

## Finnair

Then news about Finnair.

Finnair has canceled many flights this week.

Finnair has canceled over 50 flights this week. There may also be changes to weekend flights.

Finnair has canceled many flights because the seats on some aircraft were washed incorrectly. Improper washing can impair the fire safety of the aircraft.

## Daycare

More news about daycare.

Younger and younger children are being brought to daycare.

This is Livia Tynkkynen, who started daycare at just over a year old. Livia is in care two days a week when both parents are at work.

Last year, more than 40 percent of children under the age of two were in day care, according to the Finnish National Board of Education. Even the number of children under the age of one in day care has increased.

Children are starting daycare at an earlier age because there has been a big change in parents' attitudes. Parents value early childhood education from very young children.

The weak economic situation and uncertain working life are also causing many parents to return to work sooner than before.

## Saturday weather

Forecast.

The weather will vary on Saturday.

It may rain or snow in Lapland. Elsewhere it is cloudy and sunny.

The temperature is 2-9 degrees.
