Homelessness. Mortgages. Memorial Day play. Thursday weather.

## Homelessness

First, the news about homelessness.

More and more families with children may be left without a home.

Leena from Turku is packing her things because she is moving.

The reason is financial difficulties.

Leena's employer went bankrupt. The salary in her new job is lower than before.

Leena can no longer pay the rent, so she moves in with a friend.

Leena's 17-year-old son also loses his second home. The boy now lives entirely with his father.

More and more families with children may be left without a home.

The reasons are the poor economic situation and social security cuts.

The situation is most difficult for single parents and young parents.

## Mortgages

Now the news about mortgages.

The amount of housing loans varies greatly across Finland.

The largest mortgages are in Uusimaa, where they average around 250,000 euros.

The smallest mortgages are in South Savo and Kainuu, where mortgages average less than 100,000 euros.

This is according to a study by OP-Pohjola Bank.

The amount of the mortgage has a significant impact on housing costs.

The largest loan repayments are made in Espoo. The average repayment for families in Espoo is 1,300 euros per month.

The amount of housing loans varies greatly across Finland.

That is why housing costs also vary greatly.

## Memorial Day play

Finally, cultural news.

This is where we are rehearsing the play Remembrance Day at the Finnish National Theatre.

The play is about Finns who left for the Soviet Union in the 1930s.

At least 15,000 people left Finland for the Soviet Union. They admired Soviet socialism or were fed up with conditions in Finland.

Thousands of them disappeared during Stalin's persecution.

The story of the play is fictional, but it is based on true information.

Information has been collected from archives, letters, diaries and interviews.

The premiere of the play Remembrance Day is today, Wednesday, at the Finnish National Theatre.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The sun will shine in the north on Thursday.

Snow and sleet are falling in the southern and central parts of the country.

It's freezing almost all over the country.
