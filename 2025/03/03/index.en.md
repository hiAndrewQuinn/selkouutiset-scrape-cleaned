War in Ukraine. Studying. Laskiainen. Weather.

## War in Ukraine

First, the topic of the war in Ukraine.

European leaders had a meeting in London on Sunday.

The topic of the meeting was how to bring peace to Ukraine.

Finnish President **Alexander Stubb** was also at the meeting.

After the meeting, France and Britain made a proposal.

They suggested that Russia and Ukraine take a break from fighting.

During the pause, they will not fight at sea or in the air. Ground forces will not be affected by the pause initially.

European leaders held a meeting on Ukraine in London on Sunday.

European countries agree with Ukraine that they will begin preparing for peace together.

Some European countries say they can send soldiers to Ukraine once the war is over.

Soldiers ensure that peace is maintained.

Russia invaded Ukraine 3 years ago.

## Studying

Then the topic is studying.

Universities want more students whose native language is not Finnish.

Students for whom Finnish is a second language are welcome to study in Finnish.

That is why the University of Jyväskylä will start an experiment next year.

The experiment will include a separate application for students for whom Finnish is a second language.

Maybe it will attract more students.

The experiment concerns, for example, teacher training in Finnish.

We want more students whose native language is not Finnish to study in Finnish at university.

## Laskiainen

Then the topic is the snowman.

Sunday was the feast of the Assumption. The feast begins the anticipation of Easter.

Laskiais buns are an old delicacy from Laskiais.

Merchants say that they sold a lot of Christmas buns this year, many millions.

Laskiais buns were sold 30 percent more than last year.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, the sun will shine in the west and Lapland. It may snow in the east.

There is a little frost in the north.

Elsewhere, the temperature is between +1 and +5 degrees.
