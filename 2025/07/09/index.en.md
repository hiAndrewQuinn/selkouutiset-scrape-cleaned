## US military aid to Ukraine

First, about the USA and the war in Ukraine.

The US is sending more defensive weapons to Ukraine. The US Department of Defense, or Pentagon, says that President Donald Trump has decided to send them.

The Trump administration has had mixed reactions to arms aid. Last week, the US announced it would suspend ammunition deliveries to Ukraine.

Trump may give a new air defense system to Ukraine, according to the American newspaper The Wall Street Journal.

Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin with exceptional force yesterday.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

## Radioactivity of fungi

Then about radioactive radiation.

The Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority STUK is investigating the radioactivity of edible mushrooms. The nuclear power plant exploded in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986. The country was part of the Soviet Union.

Radioactive substances spread to Finland with rain and air currents.

Jämsä in Central Finland also fell into the area where the most radioactive cesium and iodine fell.

The amount of cesium is still highest in the reddest areas. However, the radioactivity is still low enough that the mushrooms are safe to eat.

STUK is asking mushroom pickers to send one liter of fresh or dried edible mushrooms by post.

Samples have never been collected on such a large scale before. Until now, mushrooms have been purchased for research from markets.

## New traffic signs

Still about traffic.

Road signs are being renewed in Finland.

The new Road Traffic Act came into force in 2020. Therefore, traffic signs must also be changed at bus stops that no longer have services.

All new bus stop signs are yellow and black. At the same time, the blue and white stop signs will be removed.

Road signs are being renewed in Finland.

Site manager Toni Salojoki says that perhaps a thousand signs will be replaced this summer. It will take about a month.

## Weather

Finally, the weather forecast.

It will be sunny tomorrow.

It is cloudy in the east, but the sun is shining elsewhere in Finland.

In sunny areas, the temperature is above 20 degrees.
