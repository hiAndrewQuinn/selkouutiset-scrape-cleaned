This week, a study was published on what men in Finland think of women.

The research shows that especially young men have worrying opinions.

25 percent of men under the age of 35 say that a woman can deserve violence.

They think that a man can hit a woman if she has the wrong clothes, looks or behavior.

## Young men

Experts have pondered why young men think that a man is sometimes allowed to hit a woman.

Experts say one reason is social media. There, young men see content that glorifies violence against women.

Young men may also feel that they are not part of society. For example, it may be difficult for them to get a job. Then they might think that the status of men has worsened because the status of women has improved.

Experts also remind us that young men in Finland are often alone. Then the emotional life does not develop. The situation worsened during the Corona period.

## The situation in Finland

The number is 09 2525 0111 (in Finnish), 09 2525 0112 (in Swedish), 09 2525 0114 (in Ukrainian), 09 2525 0115 (in Russian) and 09 2525 0116 (in English).

The results of the study have shocked women.

What will our future be like if men think that a woman can deserve violence? That's what the women interviewed by Yle in Kuopio asked.

Many studies have reported that women in Finland experience more violence than in many other European countries. Usually, violence takes place in one's own home.

However, it is also good to remember the information from a new study that the majority of Finnish men say that it is always wrong to hit a woman.

Anyone can get help if they are beaten or otherwise treated violently. More information can be found, for example, at [nettiturvakoti.fi](https://nettiturvakoti.fi/).

## Repeat
