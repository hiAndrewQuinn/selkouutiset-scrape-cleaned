Artificial intelligence. Election budgets. Troop. Weather.

## Artificial intelligence

First, the topic of hiring employees.

Companies have started to use artificial intelligence when they are looking for employees.

Artificial intelligence can examine a large number of job applications in a few minutes. It suggests applicants who have exactly the qualities the employer is looking for. The employer can then invite these applicants to a job interview.

Sometimes a job interview starts with a chat, which is handled by artificial intelligence.

Companies have therefore started to use artificial intelligence when they are looking for employees.

However, it is still not very common.

Even the old ways of finding good employees still work well.

## Election budgets

Then the news about the European elections.

The parties' election budgets are of different sizes in the European elections.

The Coalition and Basic Finns spend the most money on the European elections.

The coalition's election budget is 800,000 euros. Basic Finns' election budget is 700,000 euros.

SDP spends the third most money. Its election budget is around 600,000 euros.

Smaller parties also have smaller election budgets.

The parties' election budgets are of different sizes.

The parties are now trying to reach the voters, because the election day of the European elections is already on Sunday.

15 representatives from Finland can enter the European Parliament.

## Homecoming of soldiers

Then a matter of history and Finnish soldiers.

The return home of the Finnish soldiers from the war went quite well.

This is what Jenni Kirves says, who has studied Finns' war experiences.

When the soldiers returned home in 1945, they had many years of war behind them. Some of the soldiers had trauma.

However, the soldiers' return home generally went well.

Kirves says that hard work helped the men. Physical fatigue promoted psychological well-being.

Dancing was also important. It brought joy to life.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

In the central part of the country, there will be showers and thunderstorms in places. Elsewhere it's cloudy and sunny.

The temperature is 20-27 degrees.

The southerly wind is weak to moderate.
