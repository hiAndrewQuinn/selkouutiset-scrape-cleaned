Porridge was a festive food.

Companies began celebrating Christmas parties in the 1930s. By the 1950s, many companies were already celebrating Christmas parties. Later, groups of friends and hobby groups also began celebrating Christmas parties.

Christmas Eve is usually celebrated at the end of November or during December. It is intended to be a cheerful and informal celebration, held when it is dark outside.
