Side jobs. Dentist. Book fair. Weather.

## Side jobs

First, the topic is work.

There are more people in Finland than ever before who work more than one job. The main reason for this is that the salary of their main job is not enough to live on.

Many people also work part-time for variety. Ville Ruso from Helsinki works as a swimming instructor and security guard. He also has his own art company:

*-I've been looking for different experiences and challenges. I need to stimulate my own intelligence a little in a way that allows me to do cool things.*

There are more people in Finland than ever before who work more than one job. Last year, almost 140,000 people worked more than one job.

## Students' teeth

Next, news about dental health.

Many students rarely visit the dentist. Only about 25 percent of university students visit the dentist every year.

Recommendations say that young adults should have their teeth checked every 1-4 years.

Student Emma Honkala from Kokkola:

*-Maybe I just forget. And maybe the longer I don't go, the more excitement or fear I get. I'm excited about what I'll find there.*

Many students rarely visit the dentist. Students want the dentist to send an invitation home.
