Breakage of marine cables

The topic of the news week is the unexpected breaking of submarine cables.

This week, 2 important communication cables were cut in the Baltic Sea. Cables do not break on their own. It is possible that someone cut the cables on purpose.

We will now tell you more about the breaking of submarine cables.

## External force

In Finland, it was noticed on Monday morning that the communication cable between Finland and Germany has been broken.

On Monday, information came to Finland that the sea cable between Lithuania and Sweden has also been cut.

The cable between Finland and Germany is managed by the Finnish state company Cinia.

Cinia says that the cable has been cut by some external force. Such forces can be, for example, a ship's anchor or the pulling of a fishing net on the bottom, i.e. bottom trawling.

The reason for the cable breaking can also be sabotage.

## Chinese ship

The place where the cable between Finland and Germany breaks is in the Baltic Sea south of the island of Öland.

The Danish authorities noticed that a Chinese cargo ship was moving in the area. The Danish authorities stopped the Chinese ship.

Authorities are investigating whether the Chinese ship is connected to the cable break.

## Serious act

The cable company Cinia and the politicians are careful when they talk about the cause of the cable damage. Politicians don't make guesses as to who might have broken the cables.

Many Finns think that Russia is to blame because relations between Russia and the West are bad.

Defense Minister **Antti Häkkänen** says that breaking the cable is really serious, because telecommunication connections are necessary structures for society.

Many experts and authorities say it can be difficult to prove who is guilty.

## Internet connections in Finland

Communication cables carry internet communication.

Finland's internet connections abroad have worked through other countries when the cable to Germany is cut. The cable will be fixed next week. On Thursday, the repair ship left France for the Baltic Sea.

The cable between Sweden and Lithuania will also be repaired next week.
