## Vending machines in home care

Now the topic is home care.

Vending machines are being used more than before in home care for the elderly and sick.

For example, vending machines dispense medicine in people's homes. Alli Ross has a medicine vending machine in her home:

*-I'm offering a dose of medicine. Good morning. It's time to take the medicine.*

Alli Rossi:

*-He's a trusted person. And I don't even bother listening to him, he's that big.*

Vending machines are being used more than ever in home care for the elderly and sick. Vending machines are used a lot in rural areas, where caregivers often have a long drive to visit people.
