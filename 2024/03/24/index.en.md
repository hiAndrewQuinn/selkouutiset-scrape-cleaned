Nurses' time for patients

The topic of the news week this time is nurses' time for patients. Good care involves nurses having enough time for patients.

Research shows that nurses spend a lot of time on other work than caring for patients.

Uutisviikko now tells about how nursing time was studied in a new way, and what nurses' time is spent on.

## A new research method for treatment time

Tampere University Hospital conducted a study on nurses' time with patients. Time was measured in a new way. Patients were given a wristband and nurses were given a smartphone.

The nurse's smartphone recognizes the patient's wristband when the nurse is with the patient. In this way, the smartphone collects information on how long the nurse is with different patients.

The study found that nursing work accounted for 22-40 percent of the nurse's working time. Nursing time varies in different departments of the hospital, because the departments are different.

The nurse's phone also collects information when the nurse is in the hospital's office. In the office, the nurse records the patients' information. The study found that up to 40 percent of nurses' time is spent on clerical work.

## Office work for nurses

In clerical work, nurses record patients' test results and other information. The nurses also record the patient's information whenever a new patient enters the department or when a patient leaves the department.

There are many things to record. Not all information is needed in the treatment of all patients. That's why recording sometimes frustrates nurses.

The nurses say that the amount of clerical work has increased all the time, because there have been many more record keeping duties and information systems. The study found that office work burdens the ability of many nurses to cope more than patient work.

The study was conducted at Tampere University Hospital last summer and fall. A total of 90 nurses participated in the study.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was nurses' time for patients. Nurses' time has been studied in a new way.

The research revealed that nurses spend a lot of time on clerical work. Therefore, nurses' time with patients has decreased. Office work also burdens many nurses more than patient work.

A new research method may help hospitals better plan the work of nurses.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
