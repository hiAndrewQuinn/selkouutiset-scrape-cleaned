Tomorrow's elections are important for all of us. They will determine who will make decisions in their home municipality and welfare region.

Regional elections elect regional councils. They decide on things like health centers and elderly care.

Municipal elections elect municipal councils. They decide how the municipality spends money on, for example, schools, libraries or public transport.

Municipal elections are held in all municipalities in mainland Finland.

Regional elections are held everywhere else but not in Helsinki.

## Who can vote?

Many foreigners who have lived in Finland for a long enough time are also allowed to vote in both elections.

You can vote if you have received a notification of your right to vote. It has been sent by post or electronically to the Suomi.fi service.

## There are 2 ballots

On election day, you always vote at your local polling station. The address is stated in your voting rights notice.

Polls will open tomorrow morning, Sunday, at 9 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.

You will need proof of identity. You do not need a voting rights declaration.

At the polling station, the election officer will give you 2 ballots. At the voting booth, you will write your candidate number on the ballots.

You have to be careful with the ballots and numbers. The ballot for regional elections is purple. In regional elections, all candidate numbers are 4 digits.

The ballot paper for municipal elections is white. The candidate numbers start with the number 2.

You can still check the numbers on the wall of the voting booth.

The clerk stamps the ballots, and you drop them into the ballot box, or box, at the polling station.

## Repetition
