Stock markets. Elections. Hockey. Weather.

## Stock exchanges

First, the topic is economics.

A lot has happened on world stock markets this week.

During the first week, stock prices fell sharply when the US imposed large tariffs on goods imported from other countries. Investors thought the tariffs were a bad thing.

On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced that the US would suspend tariffs on many countries. Trump decided that, for example, EU countries would not have large tariffs for the next 3 months. After Trump's decision, stock prices rose rapidly around the world. Stock prices also rose on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.

The US suspended large tariffs on many countries. After this, global stock market prices rose.

## Regional and municipal elections

The next news is about the elections.

There are two elections in Finland on Sunday. People vote in municipal and regional elections on the same day.

Elections are important to all of us. They determine who makes decisions in our home municipality and welfare region.

Many foreigners are also allowed to vote in both elections if they have lived in Finland long enough. Regional elections are held everywhere else, but not in Helsinki.

Tomorrow, Saturday, we will tell you more about who can vote and how the voting takes place. This will be covered in the Uutisviikko selkosuomeksi program.

## Ice hockey
