The President of the Republic, Sauli Niinistö, estimates that the defense agreement planned by Finland and the USA may be the reason why asylum seekers arrive at Finland's border via Russia. Maybe Russia got angry about the agreement.

Niinistö says that there may be difficult situations on Finland's eastern border in the future as well. The president commented on the situation on the eastern border in Bonn, Germany, where he is currently visiting.

During the day, more than 60 asylum seekers have come to the border stations in Southeast Finland. They do not have a visa to Finland.

The official says that Some has enough corona vaccine. Booster doses of the corona vaccine are enough for all those people for whom the vaccine is now recommended.

Booster vaccines are recommended during the fall and winter for those people who are at the highest risk of getting severe corona disease. The biggest risk factor is a person's old age.

Fur breeders have applied to the Finnish government for compensation for animals that had to be killed because of bird flu. The fur breeders have applied for a total of 6 million euros in compensation.

So far, 12 fur farms have applied for compensation. A total of 42 fur farms have already had bird flu. Fur animals must be killed if the animals in the fur farm have bird flu. The purpose is to prevent bird flu from spreading.
