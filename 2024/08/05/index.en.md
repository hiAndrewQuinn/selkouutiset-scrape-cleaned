## Labor market

First, news about working life.

Next fall's negotiations on employment contracts will be difficult.

The trade unions are angry because the government has cut unemployment benefits, for example. The government has also weakened the trade unions' right to strike.

Employers like government policy, unions don't.

Autumn's negotiations on employment contracts are likely to be difficult.

Last spring, the trade unions organized large strikes because of the government's policy. The strikes did not affect the government.

Employers still got angry because of the strikes because the companies lost a lot of money.

The unions say they may go on strike again in the fall.

## The coronavirus

Then the news about the coronavirus

The number of coronavirus infections has increased. There have been more infections for a few weeks now.

There have been small corona epidemics at festivals and other summer events.

However, there have not been as many corona infections as last year.

The number of coronavirus infections is increasing. Infections have increased earlier in the summer than a year ago.

No one knows exactly how many infections there are. The reason is that people rarely take the corona test.

Doctors recommend that old people and people with any disease take the corona vaccination.

## Berries and apples

Another little news about berries and apples.

Berries and apples have ripened earlier than normal. The reason is that the spring was warm.

Because of the warm spring, the apple trees bloom early. In southern Finland, the first apples were already picked last week.

The time for the biggest harvest of berries is now or it has already passed.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

On Tuesday, it can rain and thunder in the afternoon. The sun is shining elsewhere. The temperature is 20--25 degrees.
