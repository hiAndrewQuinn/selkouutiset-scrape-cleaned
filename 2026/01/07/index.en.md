Ukraine and Greenland. Appliance repairers. National parks. Weather.

## Ukraine and Greenland

First, foreign policy.

President Alexander Stubb says that Finland will participate in peacekeeping in Ukraine in one way or another in the future. Stubb said that Finland's role is still open.

The President spoke about the matter at a press conference after yesterday's Ukraine meeting in Paris.

President Stubb also said that Finland supports Denmark in the dispute that has arisen over Greenland.

US President Donald Trump has once again said that he wants Greenland under US control.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says US goal is to buy Greenland from Denmark

## Appliance repairers

Then the topic is repairing household appliances.

There is a shortage of home appliance repairers in Finland. New repairers have not been trained for over 10 years. Many repair shops close when a repairer retires.

However, there is plenty of work for repairmen.

Matti Vähämäki repairs household appliances in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki. He says his phone can ring up to 100 times a day.

The EU also wants more and longer-lasting repairs on household appliances. Repairs save money and reduce waste.

## National Parks

Then we'll talk about national parks.

Finland's national parks have expanded significantly in recent years.

National parks have grown by a total of about 77 square kilometers this decade. That's the equivalent of more than 10,000 football fields.

For example, a 10-hectare area was annexed to Koli National Park in North Karelia in the autumn.

Similar expansions have been made in almost all national parks.

Finland's national parks are slowly growing.

The state expands parks by purchasing small areas of land from private landowners.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be cloudy in most parts of the country tomorrow, Thursday.

It is also widely clear in the east and north.

It may snow on the west coast.
