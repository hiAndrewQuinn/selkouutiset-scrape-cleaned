The USA and Finland have signed a letter of intent on icebreakers.

An icebreaker is a ship that breaks ice using its own weight. It opens a route for other ships in winter and in the Arctic, the northernmost region in the world.

President Alexander Stubb and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo met with President Donald Trump in the USA and signed the agreement.

Finland will first build 4 icebreakers in Finnish shipyards. Then the USA will use Finnish expertise and build 7 icebreakers in its own shipyards.

The total value of the deal is approximately 6 billion euros. Approximately 2 billion of this amount concerns the breakers, which will be built in Finland.

The agreement will provide jobs for thousands of workers in Finland. This is important because Finland's economic growth has been slow.

## Breakers are being built in Rauma and Helsinki
