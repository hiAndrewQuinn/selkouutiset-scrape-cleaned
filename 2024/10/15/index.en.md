The missing children. Stubb in Norway. Gothic Modern. Weather.

## The missing children

First we will talk about the missing children.

Children and young people disappear from Finnish schools every year. The missing children have an immigrant background, but they often grew up in Finland.

For example, Lilian disappeared from Finland when she was 13, and her father took her to Iraq. The father left Lilian in Iraq because the parents thought the daughter was too Finnish. The parents were afraid that Lilian's behavior would damage the family's honor.

Children and young people disappear from Finnish schools every year. No one knows the exact number.

Police say helping these children is difficult. There are also no clear instructions for helping.

More on this topic is told in Yle's MOT program![Disappeared due to honor](https://areena.yle.fi/1-66871378) at Yle Areena.

## Presidential couple in Norway

Then we will talk about the state visit of the President of Finland.

President Alexander Stubb and Mrs. Suzanne Innes-Stubb have started a state visit to Norway.

King Harald and Queen Sonja received the presidential couple at the Royal Palace in Oslo.

The visit lasts three days.

## Gothic Modern

Then visual arts.

A new exhibition has opened in Helsinki's Ateneum art museum, the main attraction of which are skeletons and skulls. The exhibition is Gothic Modern - from darkness to light.

Artists in the exhibition include, for example, Vincent van Gogh, Hugo Simberg, Edvard Munch and KÃ¤the Kollwitz. The art of the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance inspired these artists when they depict, for example, death, love or suffering.

The Ateneum's new exhibition has particularly interested the young audience.

Atte Tolonen from Helsinki came to see one particular work.

-- Actually, I came to see van Gogh's Smoking Skeleton, that's what I especially came to see.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

It rains a little in the middle parts of the country. There will also be water and snow showers in Northern Lapland.

Cloudiness is abundant in the east and north, elsewhere the sun gets to shine a little in places.

The temperature is 2-11 degrees.
