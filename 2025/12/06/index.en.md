## Reserve

Finnish defense operates in such a way that Finland has a sufficient number of trained soldiers, or reserves.

The reserve is approximately 280,000 soldiers, which is enough to defend Finland.

Commander Jaakkola says that as the birth rate in Finland decreases, fewer young people will join the army than before.

Jaakkola says that the Finnish system is currently working well.

However, in the future, we must consider how to ensure a sufficient number of soldiers.

Maybe more women are needed in the military.

## Developing your own defense

Commander Jaakkola says that Finland must prepare for new threats and changes in the security situation.

Jaakkola says that Finland cannot copy the solutions of other countries, but must develop its own defense.

The war in Ukraine has taught us that defense must be prepared for many things.

New technologies include artificial intelligence and drones.

Drones can perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. For example, artificial intelligence can control weapons and systems.

Jaakkola says that old weapons systems, such as artillery and air force, are also important for Finland's defense.

## Financing

Finland will spend more money on defense in the coming years than before.

Finland has promised to spend 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense by 2035.

This means approximately 11 billion euros per year.

Money is needed for new weapons, technology and personnel.

Jaakkola says that the Defence Forces do not need to hire new employees for all the expertise.

There are many companies in Finland that employ top experts in artificial intelligence and technology.

The Defense Forces can cooperate with these companies.
