The SDP is the most popular party in Yle's survey.

## Meadows

Next news from the meadows.

Meadows, or flower fields, may decrease because domestic animals no longer graze freely outdoors.

For example, sheep maintain meadows by eating harmful plants. This keeps the meadows open.

Meadows are important for nature. They are home to a variety of flowers that are important for insects.

The state hopes to increase the number of meadows. However, the state has reduced the money it pays farmers for managing the meadows.

Meadows may decrease if livestock no longer eat in the meadows.
