Electric scooters have become popular. They are used especially by young people. However, many accidents occur with scooters.

For example, this week in Helsinki, the police were informed of at least 3 accidents involving electric scooters. In at least 2 of the accidents, the scooter driver was under 15 years old.

Accidents also happen outside the capital region. For example, 18 people injured in scooter accidents have already been treated at the North Karelia Central Hospital in Joensuu this month.

Many accidents involving electric scooters are caused by the driver not knowing or not following traffic rules.

Scooters are driven on the sidewalk. They are driven too fast and recklessly. Scooter drivers do not follow pedestrian crossing rules or the duty to give way. This is how Chief Inspector Dennis Pasterstein lists the causes of accidents.

However, scooters are subject to the same traffic rules and obligations as bicycles.

The law also says that only 1 person can be on the board. Yet many people often have a friend on board as well.

The rules for electric scooters are getting stricter.

In the future, scooter drivers must be at least 15 years old. Transport Minister Lulu Ranne says that the age limit will come into effect before Midsummer.

There will also be a blood alcohol limit for drivers. You may not drive an electric scooter if your blood alcohol content is 0.5 per mille or higher.

The purpose of the stricter regulations is to improve traffic safety.
