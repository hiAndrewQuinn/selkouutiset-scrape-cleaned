### Investigation of the Chinese ship

Finland begins the investigation of the Chinese cargo ship Newnew Polar Bear in China. Finland wants to find out if the ship has damaged the Balticconnector gas pipeline in the Gulf of Finland.

The ship has arrived in China.

A leak was detected in a gas pipeline on October 8 in the sea in Finland's economic zone. The Finnish authorities started an investigation into the matter, which has been led by the Central Criminal Police.

The Politico online publication says that the Finnish authorities are starting to investigate the ship. Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told the newspaper about the matter. Valtonen did not say whether Finland will investigate the ship itself in China or whether the Chinese will assist in the investigation.

### Students' scientific thinking

University students' understanding of scientific thinking is not always enough. This is what the doctoral research Heidi Salmento has done at the University of Turku says.

A weak assessment of knowledge can be a hindrance in working life. For example, the work of an expert requires good scientific thinking.

A critical attitude towards knowledge and its acquisition is the basis of scientific thinking. A university student must know the research methods of his field.

Research shows that not everyone learns even the basic concepts of science during their studies. Heidi Salmento says that science concepts need to be taught better at the university.

### Regulation of artificial intelligence

The European Union has reached a preliminary agreement on a law that regulates the use of artificial intelligence.

This is the first international attempt to limit the use of artificial intelligence.

The agreement respects human rights in the digital age, European values, but encourages the development of artificial intelligence.

### Police dogs

Finnish police dogs have many different tasks.

The Police University of Applied Sciences says that one new task may soon be the work of an electronic dog. Electronic dogs can help investigate crimes where, for example, phones or computers are hidden.

The police are also assisted by special dogs that help to investigate, for example, sexual crimes. Secretions include, for example, sweat, urine and semen.

Currently, about 40 percent of police dogs are drug dogs.

Dogs can also specialize in searching for, for example, money or explosives.

### Weather

The weather is cloudy in most of Finland. Snow falls especially in the south and east and also in western and southwestern Lapland.

The frost is 5 degrees in the south and 15 to 18 degrees in the north.

By Monday, 5 to 10 cm of snow may accumulate in the south and east. Driving weather is bad at times.
