## Security of cities

First, news about the safety of cities.

Vantaa, Oulu and Turku are currently the most unsafe cities in Finland.

The matter becomes clear from the police's new statistics. The statistics examine the safety situation in public places in Finland's 10 largest cities.

For example, the security situation in Oulu has deteriorated. Police say it stems from a series of stabbings in the city in June.

However, the security situation in many large cities has improved. For example, it is safer in Helsinki, Espoo and Pori now than a year ago.

Kuopio and Lahti are now the safest.

## Polka strawberry

Then about the strawberry.

Plant diseases threaten the Polka strawberry.

Polka used to be a hardy berry. However, the cultivation conditions have changed, and now Polka is easily affected by pests and plant diseases. Diseases come to Finland with seedlings from Central Europe.

Polka strawberry has been a favorite of Finns for a long time. It is a sweet and good preserve berry.

However, plant diseases threaten the Polka strawberry.

Because of that, the cultivation of Polka will probably decrease in the next few years and a new strawberry species may take its place.

## Old cars

Then we talk about really old cars.

On Finnish roads, you can come across passenger cars that are about a hundred years old

There are still more than 400 passenger cars in traffic that are around a hundred years old, says the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Traficom.

Teijo Luoma from Simo bought this A-Ford from 1928 last fall.

The car was in bad condition, but Luoma has repaired it to driving condition. In the fall, he will finally be able to drive it.
