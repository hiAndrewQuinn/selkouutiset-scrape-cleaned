The big thing in the news this week has been the conversion law. The law concerns the security of Finland's eastern border.

Parliament voted on the conversion law on Friday. Parliament approved the law after a very tight vote. The fate of the law was decided by the SDP party.

The SDP is not in the government, and some SDP MPs opposed the conversion law.

Enough SDP MPs still voted in favor of the conversion law, and the law was approved.

## What is conversion law?

What is conversion law? The Return Act means that the asylum application at the Finnish border can be suspended. Then asylum seekers cannot enter Finland.

The reason for the conversion law is that Russia started sending asylum seekers to Finland in the winter.

Russia wanted to cause problems in Finland that way. The purpose of the Extradition Act is to prevent Russia from using asylum seekers against Finland.

With the help of the Return Act, asylum seekers on the eastern border can be immediately returned to Russia.

Finland uses the Conversion Act if the government and the president decide so.

## Difficult law

It was really difficult to make the conversion law in the parliament. Many experts say that the conversion law violates, for example, international agreements.

After all, international agreements say that seeking asylum cannot be prevented. It is difficult for Finland to break international agreements.

The government still says that the Conversion Act is needed for Finland's security.

## Bad relations between Finland and Russia

The reason for the translation law is the bad relations between Finland and Russia.

Relations between Finland and Russia have been really bad since Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022.

Today, Russia thinks that Finland is Russia's enemy. That is why Russia wants to cause problems for Finland.

## Repeat

This time the topic of the news week has been the conversion law. Let's repeat the most important things.

Parliament approved the conversion law on Friday.

The Repatriation Act can prevent you from applying for asylum in Finland.

The purpose of the Reversal Act is to improve the security of the eastern border.

This was Uutisviikko in clear Finnish. See you again, by the way!
