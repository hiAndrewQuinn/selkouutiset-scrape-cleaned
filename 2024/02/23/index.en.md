Political strikes. Young men and alcohol. Hearing flight. Saturday's weather.

## Political strikes

First, news about working life.

The government has told how it plans to limit political strikes.

A strike is political if it is used to oppose the plans of the government or parliament. For example, there have been many political strikes this winter.

Labor Minister Arto Satonen said yesterday that the government now wants limits on the duration of political strikes.

The purpose is that the political strike may last only 24 hours. The government therefore proposes that an employee may only be off work for 1 day due to a political strike.

The government wants to limit political strikes.

The intention is that the new regulations will enter into force in the summer.

## Young men and alcohol

Then the topic is alcohol.

Young men drink less alcohol than before.

A survey by the Institute of Health and Welfare shows that young men's alcohol consumption has changed a lot.

In the past, young men used alcohol more and more often than young women.

Now there are about as many sober young men as there are sober young women. A sober person does not drink alcohol at all.

Young men drink less alcohol than before.

One of the reasons is that young men want to take care of their own health. They want to be in good shape.

## Hearing flight

Then the topic of hearing.

The spaceship Odysseus has flown to the Moon.

Odysseus landed on the surface of the Moon last night. There are no humans on board the Odysseus spaceship.

This is the first time that a spacecraft of a private company flies to the Moon.

Odysseus is owned by an American company. The company transports supplies from the US space agency NASA to the Moon.

The spaceship Odysseus landed on the moon.

This is the first American flight to the Moon in more than 50 years.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Saturday will be mild and mostly cloudy, the sun will shine in places.

New rains are already arriving from the south.

The temperature is between 0 and +4 degrees.
