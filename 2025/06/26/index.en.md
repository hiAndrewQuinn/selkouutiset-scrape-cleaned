Baltic Sea. Russia sanctions. Travel to Finland. Weather.

## Baltic Sea

First, news about the state of the Baltic Sea.

This is the research vessel Aranda. It is studying the state of Finnish waters. The news is bad.

The Baltic Sea is in bad shape.

There are large areas in the main basin of the Baltic Sea where the seabed is dead. In these areas, the sea is devoid of oxygen and animals.

The condition of the seabed in the Gulf of Finland has also deteriorated. There are more dead spots than before.

The Baltic Sea is in bad shape.

Too many nutrients are still flowing into the sea and the Baltic Sea is becoming eutrophic. This brings algae blooms into the sea in the summer and worsens oxygen depletion.

## Russia sanctions

Then the topic is sanctions against Russia.

A large number of aircraft parts have been exported to Russia despite sanctions, according to a report by Yle's investigative editorial team.

Aircraft parts worth almost a billion euros have been exported to Russia during the war in Ukraine.

However, the purpose of Western sanctions against Russia has been to prevent the export of parts.

Parts of Boeing and Airbus aircraft have been exported to Russia. They have been exported to Russia by brokers, particularly from the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China.

## Travel

Then we'll talk about tourism.

More tourists are coming to Finland now than last year. Overnight stays by foreign tourists increased by approximately 11 percent in the first half of the year compared to last year.

Tourists now come from countries such as Germany, Britain and the USA.

Americans John Swanson and Marie Johnson say that they are interested in sauna, food and culture in Finland.

Indian people Raman and Thailambal Narayamaswami came to Finland to see what the happiest country and people in the world look like.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Friday, it will be dry in much of the country.

It may rain during the day. The rain is light.

The temperature is around 14-21 degrees.
