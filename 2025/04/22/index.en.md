The death of the Pope. The price of coffee. Eurovision and politics. Weather.

## The Pope is dead

Sad news at first.

Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, has died. The Argentine-born pope died at the age of 88 yesterday morning.

Just the other day, he participated in the Easter celebration at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

Francis was elected Pope of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013.

He wanted to reform the Vatican administration and also intervened in the sexual abuse of children within the Catholic Church.

Pope Francis' speeches frequently mentioned the disadvantaged and marginalized people in society.

Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, has died.

The funeral must be held within 6 days of the death.

## The price of coffee has risen

Then about the price of coffee.

The price of coffee has risen a lot.

Yle calculated how much it has become more expensive if you drink 3 cups of coffee every day.

A year ago it cost over 180 euros and at current prices it costs over 280 euros per year.

The coffee in the test was Juhla mocha and the prices are from the S Group online store.

The price of coffee is affected by factors such as US tariff policy and natural conditions. The price of green coffee is now at a historic high.

In Finland, however, grocery stores decide the selling price themselves, which is why many people follow the offers closely.

## Eurovision and politics

Finally, about Eurovision.

Politics has no place in Eurovision. This is a point reiterated by the contest's organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

However, a Yle documentary series shows that politics has been part of the competition from the beginning. The documentary is called Eurovision: War and Love.

Last year's competition in Sweden was perhaps the most political ever. Protesters demanded that Israel be excluded from the competition due to the war in Gaza.

This year, they want politics to stay out of Eurovision.

Several humorous performances will now be heard, such as Bara bada bastu by the Finnish band KAJ, representing Sweden.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Wednesday.

It can rain almost all over the country.

In the south and east, the temperature is below 10 degrees, while it is cooler in the north and west.
