## Many problems

Yle met several taxi drivers in Rovaniemi who work there in the winter.

Many drivers say they are concerned about safety and have encountered hostility.

Some drivers say that customers don't come to them. For example, people have been told that they should only take taxis they know.

Some of the drivers have already left for Southern Finland because working in Rovaniemi is difficult.

Some drivers have to sleep in their cars or, for example, in a gym because accommodation in Rovaniemi is expensive and the work shifts are long.

## Taxi Association

The CEO of the Taxi Association **Annukka Mickelsson** condemns the vandalism that has occurred in Rovaniemi.

Mickelsson says that anyone who has a license to drive a taxi has the right to do this job.

The Taxi Association says that the problems are caused by weak regulation and fierce competition among taxis.

The Taxi Association hopes that the new laws will improve the situation and increase safety.

## Taxi rank arrangements

Taxi competition is fierce in Rovaniemi during the winter tourist season.

Many taxi drivers come from other parts of Finland. Some of the drivers drive for traditional taxi companies and some of the drivers drive for Uber or Bolt.

The organization and competition of public taxi ranks cause problems. Some taxis have to wait far from the front doors of the train station or airport.

Customers often choose a taxi from a familiar company, and some drivers feel that they are being directed to a more marginalized position.

Police say that price uncertainties and taxi traffic are also causing problems.

Some customers have reported that taxi rides in Rovaniemi have sometimes been surprisingly expensive.
