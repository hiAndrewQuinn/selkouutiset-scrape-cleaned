## Auer and Ihle's trial ends

First, news about Anneli Auer's trial.

The public has been following the trial of Anneli Auer and Jens Ihle for a long time. They are accused of brutal sexual and violent crimes.

Auer and Ihle were convicted of the crimes in 2013. The following year, the conviction was overturned because Auer's children said they lied about the sexual crimes.

However, the charges were brought again.

Prosecutors believe the children were not lying. Prosecutors believe Auer and Ihle sexually abused the children.

The trial ends today. The verdict will come later.

## Auditor: Government is exaggerating savings

Next news about government savings.

The government's savings are only 3.5 billion euros, says the National Audit Office.

The government has said that its cuts will save money by up to 10 billion euros. The government has made big cuts, for example to social benefits.

The Finnish Audit Office has calculated that there will be fewer savings due to tax cuts. The government decided to reduce some taxes this year and next year.

The government will not manage to save 10 billion euros, the National Audit Office calculates.

## It's hard to become a Wolt food delivery person

Finally, news about Wolt.

It's difficult to become a Wolt food delivery person. This is because food delivery requires a work account, which is difficult to obtain.

That's why many food delivery people rent an account and have to pay up to 900 euros per month for it. Accounts are rented, for example, on Facebook.

Mohammed Wasayh has previously rented a Wolt account. He says that account owners often want the rental payment in cash, which allows them to avoid taxes.

Wolt says that the company does not condone tax evasion. However, the company does not prohibit the use of a surrogate. According to Wolt, the owner of the work account is an entrepreneur and has the right to hire a surrogate.
