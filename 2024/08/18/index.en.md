## Finland's interestingness

Finland is of less interest to international experts than before. This is according to a study carried out by the Engineers Union and the Technical Academic Trade Union.

These unions include, for example, engineers and diploma engineers. Many of them work in the field of digital technology.

For example, there are many people working in the gaming industry who have come to Finland from abroad.

## Thoughts about Finland

Almost 90 percent of foreign experts consider the immigration debate in Finland to be worrying.

Most of them estimate that Finland will not be a better place for immigrants in 5 years.

Only about half of foreign experts recommend Finland as a place to live and work for other foreigners.

More than 40 percent of skilled workers have experienced discrimination in Finland. The reason for experiencing discrimination has been, for example, the fact that the person does not know Finnish.

Another reason for experiencing discrimination is the feeling that foreign qualifications or work experience are not valued in Finland.

## Tightening of immigration policy

Trade unions in the technical sector fear that Finland's attractiveness will decrease because the government is tightening immigration policy.

The government wants to change the law so that if an immigrant becomes unemployed, he must find a new job or leave Finland within 6 months.

Obtaining citizenship is also becoming more difficult. The government's intention is that in the future you can apply for citizenship only after 8 years. Nowadays, 5 years is enough.

Skilled workers' unions are afraid that Finland will drive away the people who make Finland's economic growth.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was foreign experts in Finland. Let's repeat the most important things.

Finland is of less interest to international experts than before.

Many experts in the technical field from abroad work in Finland. Only about half of them recommend Finland to other foreigners. The reason is the negative immigration debate in Finland. The government is also tightening immigration policy.

Many companies need foreign experts. That's why trade unions in the technical sector are worried about the situation.

This was a news week in clear Finnish, see you again, by the way!
