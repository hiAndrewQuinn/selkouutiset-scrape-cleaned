There are fewer summer jobs available this year than before.

For example, the job search service Duunitor published about 4,300 summer job advertisements in March. It is almost half less than in March last year.

The Finnish Confederation of Business and Industry EK says that economic uncertainty is reflected in the number of summer jobs. In EK's survey, more than 20 percent of the companies said that they will take on fewer summer workers this summer than before.

## There are still jobs available

TE offices say that there are still summer jobs in all fields. There is also a shortage of workers in some sectors.

A lot of summer workers are needed, for example, in the social and health sector. There are also jobs in the hotel and restaurant industry, for example. There is also a shortage of security guards.

There are options for the applicant if he is ready to consider different jobs.

Young people think that looking for a summer job is stressful.

Haaga-Helia student Eevi Käki has already sent her first job applications in January. He says it's hard when you can't even get an interview.

Student Timi Rinne also says that it is difficult to find a summer job when there can be up to several thousand applicants.

Duunitor's communications manager Maiju Karhunen says that there are a lot of summer job seekers on the move now. The applicant should therefore be sensible and use his imagination.

The applicant can find a job, for example, through acquaintances or social media. You can also ask the employer directly about a summer job.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was summer jobs. Let's repeat the most important things.

Summer jobs are still available in all fields. For example, there is a shortage of workers in the hotel and restaurant industry and in the care industry.

You should be smart when looking for a job. You can ask for a job directly at the job you are interested in. You can also look for work through acquaintances and social media.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
