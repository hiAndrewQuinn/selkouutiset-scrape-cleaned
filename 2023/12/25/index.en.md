The police say that Christmas Eve was quite peaceful throughout Finland.

The police had the normal Christmas number of alarms. For example, the police in Southwest Finland received about 30 alarms. There were alarms about domestic violence, noise and other disturbances.

The Eastern Finland police had the same number of alarms. It caught drunk drivers, for example. Christmas Eve was not particularly busy for the police in Eastern Finland.

A car accident happened on Saturday morning in Vallila, Helsinki, when a taxi drove through a guardrail and fell several meters. The taxi driver and two passengers were injured in the accident.

The police are investigating what caused the accident.

### Dogs and cats

Owners of dogs and cats may face a large additional fee in the future. The reason is that the European Union, or EU, wants to change the registration of cats and dogs.

The EU wants dogs and cats to be registered only by a veterinarian. The EU also wants that only a veterinarian can put a chip, or identification tag, on cats and dogs.

It costs a lot because the vet is expensive.

Today, the owner can register the cat or dog himself. The chip can be inserted by anyone with training. It's pretty cheap.

Associations of dog and cat owners criticize the EU's plan. Organizations think it's pointless.

### White Christmas

The whole of Finland has a white Christmas, which means the country is covered in snow.

The most snow is in the central and eastern part of the country, more than 30 centimeters more than normal at this time.

On Monday, it snowed, especially in the north. It can therefore be bad driving weather there.

Elsewhere, it has only snowed a little
