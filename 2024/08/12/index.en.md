Olympics. The Finnish man and the British riots. Lego fair. Weather.

## The Olympics ended in Paris

First, the topic is the Olympics.

The Paris Olympics are over.

Paris organized the great Olympic Games. The graduation party was celebrated yesterday.

Finally, the Olympic flag left for Los Angeles, where the next Olympics will be held in 4 years.

So the Paris Olympics are over.

Finnish athletes did not succeed in Paris. Finland did not get any medals. That has never happened at the Olympics before.

Finland's sports leaders admit that Finland's poor success was disappointing.

Director Matti Heikkinen from the Finnish Olympic Committee says that now is the time to look ahead and make changes so that Finland starts getting medals again.

## A Finn helped the rioters

Then the news about the protests in Britain.

British protesters have received help from a Finnish man.

There have been violent demonstrations or riots in Britain. They have opposed immigration.

Yle's information says that a Finnish man has helped the protesters online.

For example, the man has given instructions on how to carry out arson attacks.

The British protesters have therefore received help from a Finnish man.

The riots in Britain started when 3 little girls were stabbed to death.

It was claimed online that the stabber is an asylum seeker and a Muslim. However, that is not true.

The police suspect that the stabber is a boy with an immigrant background.

## Lego fair

Finally, we go to the Lego fair.

The Lego fair was organized over the weekend at the Helsinki Messukeskus.

There were many Lego enthusiasts who presented their own collections.

The public got to see what can be built from small plastic blocks.

Legos are often a family hobby.

Here, Anders Blomberg presents the family's Lego collections together with his son and granddaughter.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The sun is shining in a large part of Finland.

There may be rain showers in some places. Rain showers are weak.

The temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees.

The wind is weak.
