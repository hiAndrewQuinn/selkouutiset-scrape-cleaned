Municipal elections. Regional elections. Election victory. Election defeat. Tuesday's weather.

## Municipal election results

The topic of the news bulletin is the results of regional and municipal elections.

The winning party in both the regional and municipal elections is the SDP.

The SDP was the most popular party in both elections.

The SDP's support in the municipal elections was 23 percent.

The second most popular party in the municipal elections was the National Coalition Party, with support for the National Coalition Party reaching almost 22 percent.

The third most popular party was the Centre Party, with support for the Centre Party at just over 16 percent.

The fourth most popular party in the municipal elections was the Greens, with almost 11 percent support.

The fifth most popular party in the municipal elections was the Left Alliance, with support of over 9 percent.

## Regional election results

Let's continue with the election results.

The three most popular parties in regional elections are also the same as in municipal elections.

The most popular party in the regional elections was the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second most popular party was the National Coalition Party (Kolkooms) and the third most popular party was the Centre Party.

SDP Chairman **Antti Lindtman** is pleased that the SDP was the most popular party in both elections.

"*Thank you, people of Finland. Thank you, Finns. You are the biggest winners tonight.*"

The reason for the SDP's popularity is perhaps the government's policies. The SDP is not in the government.

Not all people like the government's policies. In that case, people often vote for a party that is not in government.

## The defeat of the Finns Party

Both elections were a defeat for the governing Finns Party.

The party's support dropped significantly.

The Finns Party was the sixth most popular party in both regional and municipal elections, behind, for example, the Left Alliance and the Greens.

The chairman of the Finns Party **Riikka Purra** is annoyed.

Political scientist **Elina Kestil√§-Kekkonen** says that there was one clear winner in the elections, the Social Democratic Party, and one clear loser, the Finns Party.

It is also significant that the ruling party, the National Coalition Party, did quite well, but the ruling party, the Finns Party, lost a lot of support.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Tuesday. It may rain in Lapland. Elsewhere it will be dry and sunny.

In the north, the temperature is below 5 degrees Celsius. In the south, the temperature can be above 15 degrees Celsius.
