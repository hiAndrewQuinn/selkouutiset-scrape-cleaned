Finns have been shocked by the death of a young girl. The girl died at the weekend in Valkeakoski, Southern Finland.

The girl was found dead in the forest. The place is not very far from the girl's home.

Today, Sunday, the police arrested a man who may have killed the girl. So it could be a murder.

Homicide is aimed at a person's life. For example, murder and manslaughter are homicides.

The dead girl was 15 years old. It is sad that such a young person dies in a homicide.

The case also arouses fear in many young people.

## Number of homicides

However, it is good to remember that homicides have decreased.

Last year there were fewer homicides in Finland than ever before. There were less than 60 murders.

The number is clearly lower than, for example, 30 or 20 years ago.

Crime Commissioner Pasi Nieminen confirms that serious violence has decreased in Finland.

In Finland, many murders have occurred in violent gangs, and there are fewer of them today than before.

In gangs, alcohol is drunk together, and the evening can end in a violent fight.

In Finland, homicides usually take place in people's own apartments, and the weapon is a sharp weapon, for example a knife. This is where Finland is different from, for example, neighboring Sweden.

In Sweden, homicides are often committed in a public place, and the weapon is a firearm. There have been no similar cases in Finland.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was murder. Let's repeat the most important things.

A young girl died over the weekend due to a homicide.

The girl's death has shocked everyone.

However, homicides have decreased in Finland.

Last year, fewer homicides were committed in Finland than ever before.
