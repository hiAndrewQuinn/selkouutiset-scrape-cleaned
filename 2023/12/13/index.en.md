The UN climate conference in Dubai has adopted a historic resolution.

For the first time, the resolution of the Climate Conference urges countries to move away from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include oil, gas and coal.

According to the resolution, we must move away from the fossil energy system in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Carbon neutrality means that emissions and their removals, i.e. carbon sinks, are equal.

### Thursday strike day

Tomorrow, Thursday, is a big strike day in Finland.

For example, buses, trains, trams and the metro do not run. The National Road Traffic Center says that people should stay working remotely tomorrow, as there may be traffic jams.

Strikes also affect, for example, meals and cleaning at schools and daycare centers, mail delivery, and the selection of grocery stores.

About 100,000 workers from many different fields are going on strike. The strike opposes the government's reforms to working life and social security.

The strike lasts a day.

### Support measurement for the presidential election

Alexander Stubb's support has grown in Yle's new presidential survey.

About 30 percent of Finns now support Stubb in the first round of the presidential election. Stubb is the coalition's presidential candidate.

The second most popular is Pekka Haavisto, who is supported by 23 percent. Haavisto is the candidate of the voters' association, and the greens also support him.

Third is Olli Rehn, who is the candidate of the voters' association and the centre. Rehn's support was 12 percent.

The biggest change in the survey is that Mika Aaltola's support is now only 4 percent. In the previous survey a month earlier, Aaltola's support was still 9 percent. Aaltola is an uncommitted candidate.

The presidential election will be held in January.

### St. Lucia's day
