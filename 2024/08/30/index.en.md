## Value added tax

First the economic news.

Value added tax will increase.

The general value added tax is 25.5 percent from the beginning of September. It is 1.5 percentage points more than before.

If the store raises the prices by the same amount, for example the price of shampoo and toilet paper will increase by a few cents.

However, not all shops raise prices, even if the value added tax increases.

The increase in value added tax affects the prices of expensive goods the most. For example, the price of a new car can increase by several hundred euros.
