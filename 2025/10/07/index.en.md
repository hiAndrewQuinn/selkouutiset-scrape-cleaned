## Packages from China

First, news about the online store.

Chinese online stores are taking over the Finnish and European markets.

4.6 billion e-commerce packages entered the EU last year. Customs says almost all of them came from China.

Last year, over 28 million packages arrived in Finland. This year, the number of packages may already exceed 50 million.

There are so many packages coming from Chinese online stores that Customs doesn't have time to inspect them all.

Finns order mainly women's clothing, cheap jewelry and small household items from China. Customs says that the average value of one package is 6 euros.

## Vegetarian food for schools

Then the topic is school food.

Vantaa wants to increase vegetarian food in school and daycare meals.

Currently, vegetarian food accounts for about 20 percent. The goal is to increase that to over 60 percent in 10 years.

Vantaa wants to increase the amount of vegetarian food in schools for health and environmental reasons.

Aino Pesonen, Eliel Blom and Milla Nordfors from Korson Ruusuvuori School enjoy eating vegetarian food.

\- That's a good thing, because then it doesn't take as many animals, or the animals don't consume as much.

\- It doesn't bother me at all. I think vegetarian food is just as good as meat food.

\- I think it's a really nice thing. Usually the vegetarian food is really good, at least here at school.

## Architecture Award

More architecture.

This year's Finlandia Prize for Architecture will be awarded to the new headquarters of forestry company Stora Enso. The building was completed last year in Katajanokka, Helsinki.

It is the largest building made of solid wood in Finland. The lobby and roof garden are public spaces, meaning you can visit them freely. The terrace offers a view of the Helsinki seascape.

Stora Enso's new headquarters has been awarded the Finlandia Prize for architecture. The building was designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects from Helsinki.

## Wednesday's weather

On Wednesday, the rain area will move from west to east across Finland. The rain will be heavy.

The south wind is strong.

It's about 10 degrees warmer.
