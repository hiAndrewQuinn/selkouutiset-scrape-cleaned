About half of the threats occur in telephone service. A third occur in customer service at Kela service points.

Employees report every threat. Safety Director **Sami Niinikorpi** says that around 2,000 of these are reported each year.

Kela employees are often threatened, even though calls are recorded and many service points have guards.
