## Floods

Then the news about the floods.

There are floods in the Tampere region and Western Finland.

There are floods in Finland now.

The cause of the floods is the weather. The warm weather melts the snow and at the same time it rains.

The traffic is also very slippery because of the weather. These pictures are from Oulu.

## Gingerbread

Then the topic is gingerbread, i.e. pepper.

Peppers belong to Finnish Christmas.

The most popular pepper mold is heart-shaped.

Many people bake before Christmas because they want to smell peppermint at home.

This factory produces the baking paper that bakers need.

Director **Per-Henrik Hagberg** says that the factory's rush starts when it snows for the first time. That's when people notice that Christmas is coming.

However, gingerbread is not a Finnish invention.

The oldest pepper molds are 5000 years old. They have been found in India.

Gingerbread came to Finland from Germany about 300 years ago.
