## Campaign against racism

First news about politics.

The government's campaign against racism has begun.

Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** opened the campaign yesterday.

*- We invite all communities, companies, organizations, hobby clubs and other organizations to build an equal and racism-free Finland.*

The government wants racism to end in Finland.

This is how the government's campaign against racism began.

The government decided on an anti-racism campaign a year ago, when the old racist writings of fundamentalist Finnish ministers became public.

The government's campaign has also received criticism. For example, it has been asked whether the governing party Perusfuomalaiket is seriously involved in the campaign.

Many organizations think that the campaign against racism is really important.

(**Hamdi Hagiali**, member of the Finland-Somalia club)

*- This is something that affects the lives, everyday life of hundreds of people, even thousands of people. It's something that needs to be talked about, and even though the starting point was a bit silly, I hope it only goes up from here.*

## Prostate cancer

Then medical news.

Prostate cancer is being researched in Finland.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men.

More than 900 men die of prostate cancer in Finland every year.

Now researchers are finding out how prostate cancer deaths can be reduced.

It is important to find difficult prostate cancers that require treatment.

Researchers are interested in a new method that combines 2 blood tests and magnetic resonance imaging.

The method finds difficult prostate cancers better than a simple blood test.

A study on prostate cancer is underway in Finland.

It is currently the largest prostate cancer study in the world.

## School peace

Let's also say that a school truce has been declared today.

Peace of mind was declared in HÃ¤meenlinna, but peace of mind applies to all schools in Finland.

The theme of school peace this academic year is \"You are not alone\". The theme is against loneliness and bullying.

President Alexander Stubb was also present at the event.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will rain, meaning it won't rain. The sun is shining all over the country.

The day is warm. The temperature is above 20 degrees. It's almost 25 degrees in the south.
