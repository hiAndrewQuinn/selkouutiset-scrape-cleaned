## Winter storm

First the news about the winter storm.

The first storm of this winter has come to Finland. Because of the storm, the driving weather is bad.

5-20 centimeters of snow will fall in southern Finland and central Finland today.

The strong wind blows the snow into the air, and it is difficult for drivers to see well in traffic.

The police remind you that the car must now have winter tires.

## Unemployment

Then the news about unemployment.

Unemployment is increasing in Finland.

The Ministry of Labor and the Economy predicts that next year 8.5 percent of working-age people will be without a job.

It means that there will already be more than 300,000 unemployed next year.

Labor Minister Arto Satonen says that unemployment is increasing because of the bad economic situation.

The bad economic situation can be seen, for example, in the construction industry. There is little construction in Finland now, and there are many unemployed in the construction industry.

Unemployment will increase next year.

The ministry predicts that unemployment will only start to decrease in 2026.

In some sectors, unemployment is already decreasing earlier. For example, in the restaurant industry, it is expected that more jobs will start coming already at the beginning of next year.
