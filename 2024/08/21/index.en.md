Work and drugs. Northern rivers. The Jungle Book dance piece. Weather.

## Work and drugs

First, news about intoxicants in the workplace.

Alcohol and drugs cause more problems in the workplace than before. This is what the S group, which is a large employer, says.

Leading occupational well-being expert Satu Ylitalo from the S group:

\-*Yes, we have the feeling that the use of substances other than alcohol in particular is increasing. It can also be seen in our workplaces.*

Alcohol and drugs cause more problems in the workplace than before. The government wants to change the law so that it is easier to fire an employee than it is now. The expert says that in the future it may be easier to fire an employee because of intoxicants than before.

## Northern rivers

The next topic is rivers.

In northern Finland, the condition of the rivers is being improved.

In the past, humans have made such changes to rivers that fish no longer swim from the sea to the rivers. Barriers have been built in the river and the fish lack places to spawn.

Now the fish are wanted back in the rivers. That is why changes are being made to the rivers. In some rivers, for example, fishing lanes are built for fish. Stones and gravel are placed at the bottom of the rivers so that the fish have places to spawn again.

## The Jungle Book

Now the topic is a new dance piece.

Rudyard Kipling's old classic The Jungle Book has been turned into a dance performance. The show was made by British choreographer Akram Khan.

The dance performance deals with climate change. In the show, the city has become a dreary and barren place. Animals are fleeing climate change.

The jungle book has been made into a dance performance. The premiere of the dance performance will be at Tanssi talo during the Helsinki festival week on Thursday.

## Weather

Tomorrow, Thursday, it will rain in a large part of the country. In Lapland, it is dustier. It is more than 20 degrees warm in Lapland. In the rest of the country, the temperature is around 20 degrees.
