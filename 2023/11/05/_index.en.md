Experts are worried about the future of energy renovations. The state will stop subsidizing energy renovations next year.

Support has been popular. Support has been received, for example, for the construction of geothermal heating or repairing the sealing of houses. The energy efficiency of the houses has been improved with the support.

Property managers fear that energy renovations of houses will decrease because the subsidy will end.

Yle has investigated the connections of Finnish ice cream brands to Russia. Some ice cream brands have a connection to Russia.

Many large international companies still operate in Russia. The same companies also own companies that make ice cream in other countries. For example, the large international companies Nestle and Unilever own many ice cream brands in Finland.

Many companies have left Russia because Russia is at war in Ukraine. EU countries do not like the fact that companies operate in Russia. The EU has imposed sanctions on Russia because of the war.
