## Trump and Putin

First, news about the meeting between the presidents of the USA and Russia.

President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin will meet in Alaska today.

At the meeting, Trump and Putin will discuss ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump says the most important goal is to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Trump also says that preparations are now underway for the next meeting, which will also include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi.

The presidents of the US and Russia are meeting today - for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The meeting starts after 10 pm Finnish time.

## Invitations

Then news about the Finnish army.

The conscription of young men into the army has begun today. Approximately 38,000 young men will participate in the conscription ceremonies during the autumn.

This year, men born in 2007 will be called up for military service.

Women can also apply for voluntary military service in the army.

## Foreign species

Then there's the matter of alien species.

This plant is a rowanberry.

It is a common plant in Finland, for example in hedges in yards, but from today it is banned.

The common eelgrass is no longer allowed to be sold or grown in Finland. It must be eradicated from your home garden.

Leena Hamberg, a senior researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland, says that the rowan eel is a harmful invasive species. It spreads quickly and takes up living space from other plants.

In addition to the common rowan, the cultivation of the white willow willow is now prohibited in Finland. Growing them can even result in fines.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

A storm is coming to Finland. It will rain and thunder tomorrow night.

The weather tomorrow will be rainy. The wind will be strong.

The temperature is between 10 and 20 degrees.
