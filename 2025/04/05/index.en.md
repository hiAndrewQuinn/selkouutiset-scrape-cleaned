US Customs

This is Uutisviikko in plain Finnish and Tuukka Lukinmaa.

US President **Donald Trump** imposed large tariffs this week.

Tariffs apply to goods that come into the US from abroad.

US tariffs could have a really bad impact on the global economy.

Other countries are now considering how they will respond to the US tariffs.

Now we will tell you more about US tariffs.

## Big customs

US President Donald Trump imposed large tariffs on foreign goods on Wednesday.

For example, the tariff for Europeans is 20 percent and for China it is 34 percent.

Many other countries will also face high tariffs.

The US does a lot of trade with other countries, so US tariffs have a big impact on the entire world.

## What is customs?

What is a tariff? Tariffs are additional taxes that the US levies on goods that come into the US from abroad.

For example, for European shoes worth 100 euros, the surcharge is 20 euros.

European shoes that used to cost 100 euros in the USA will probably cost 120 euros in the future.

So the prices of foreign goods rise in the USA.

## Trump's goal

What is US President Donald Trump aiming for with tariffs?

One of Trump's goals is for companies to move factories to the USA.

The tariffs do not apply to goods made in the USA.

If companies move factories to the USA, more jobs will come to the USA.

## The economy is suffering

US President Donald Trump's tariffs are bad for the global economy.

When the US imposes tariffs on other countries, other countries impose tariffs on the US.

Then countries will trade less with the USA.

Economists say that when there is less trade, everyone becomes poorer.

Many Finnish companies are also becoming poorer.

In the USA, the prices of foreign goods rise due to tariffs.

That's a bad thing for the American people.

## Repetition

This time the topic was US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Let's repeat the most important things.

The US plans to impose large tariffs on goods coming from abroad.

The US hopes that due to the tariffs, companies will move factories to the US.

US tariffs are bad news for the Finnish economy and the entire global economy.

That's all for today. See you again, bye.
