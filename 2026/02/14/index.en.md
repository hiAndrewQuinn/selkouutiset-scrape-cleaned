## Changes to Kela's social assistance

This week's topic is changes to Kela's social assistance.

Some of the changes came into effect at the beginning of February and some will come into effect at the beginning of March.

The government has tightened the conditions for social assistance and many Finns now receive less support than before.

## Other supports

The biggest change is that Kela can now reduce social assistance more easily than before.

If a person does not apply for other benefits first, Kela will reduce social assistance by up to 50 percent.

Other benefits include student grants, unemployment benefits, housing allowance, parental allowance, pensions and sickness benefits.

## Terms and Conditions

The social assistance will also be reduced if the applicant does not register as a job seeker within one month of the start of unemployment.

If an immigrant does not follow the integration plan, Kela may reduce social assistance.

If an unemployed job seeker refuses to work, or does not apply for enough jobs, Kela may reduce the social assistance by 20 or 40 percent.

People under the age of 25 must apply to study if they do not have a vocational qualification after comprehensive school or upper secondary school.

All conditions must be met for a person to receive social assistance.

## Basic part

At the beginning of March, the basic part of social assistance will also be reduced by 2 or 3 percent for all adults.

For example, a person aged 18 or over who lives alone receives about 18 euros less per month than before.

Previously, a person could earn 150 euros per month without it affecting social assistance.

Now this possibility is gone.

In the future, all earned income and grants will be counted as income.

This change does not yet apply to caregivers and family carers. They are still allowed to earn 150 euros per month without it affecting their support.

The exception is valid until the end of next year.

## Rent share

Kela now pays the rent share directly to the landlord if Kela has paid a rental deposit for the apartment.

The tenant must pay the remaining rent themselves if Kela does not pay the entire rent.

This requires accuracy, as the amount of support can vary from month to month.

## Repetition

The weekly news in plain Finnish reported on changes to Kela's social assistance.

The new rules stipulate that before you can receive social assistance, you must apply for other benefits.

Support can also be reduced more easily than before.

The basic part of social assistance will decrease, and all income will affect the assistance more than before.

This was the news of the week in plain Finnish. See you again, bye!
