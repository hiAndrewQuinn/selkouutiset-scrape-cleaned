Finland has closed the border between Finland and Russia today, Friday. The limit will remain closed until mid-January.

2 Finnish border stations were open on Thursday and Friday. However, the border was closed again because a lot of asylum seekers came to the border.

Russia has sent asylum seekers towards Finland because it wants to disturb Finland. Finland wants to prevent harassment and closes the border.

Many employees are bored at work. This is what a new study conducted in Finland and Britain says.

Almost 50 percent of employees regularly feel that work is boring. It often also means that the employee is tired.

Work can be boring for many reasons. For example, unnecessary meetings and unnecessary bureaucracy make work boring and tiring.
