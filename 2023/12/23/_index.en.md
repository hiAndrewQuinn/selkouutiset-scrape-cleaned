Christmas traffic on the roads has been calm on Saturday. There were no bad traffic jams anywhere in Finland. Many people traveled to celebrate Christmas already on Friday.

The roads had the most traffic in the afternoon. The driving weather has been bad in many places due to the snowfall.

### Flights are late

Due to the snowfall, the flights are also late.

At Helsinki-Vantaa airport, many flights have been way behind schedule. In the morning, the flight from Rovaniemi to Helsinki was completely cancelled.

Finnair says that Friday's snowfall still affected flight schedules on Saturday.

### Store shelters

In the capital region, a new method is being tried, the purpose of which is to increase the safety of grocery store sellers.

For example, in Vantaa, a transparent booth has been built at the cash desk of some stores to protect the shop assistant.

The Trade Union and the Service Industry Trade Union PAM say that customers behave badly towards store salespeople more often than before. The organizations believe that the shop assistant is safer than before when there is a protective booth around the cash register.
