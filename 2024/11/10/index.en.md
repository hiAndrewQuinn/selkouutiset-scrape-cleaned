During the week of Father's Day, the Father of the Year awards will be given.

The Father of the Year award was given to 5 fathers this year. The awards were presented by Minister of Social Affairs and Health **Kaisa Juuso** on Friday in Helsinki.

The recipients of the Father of the Year award represent a wide variety of families. This year, for example, the award was given to a single father and the father of a new family.

One of the recipients of the award is [**Christoffer Vidjeskog**](https://yle.fi/a/74-20122918). Vidjeskog is a 35-year-old father of 2 from Pietarsaari.

Vidjeskog says that life changes when the first child is born. Vidjeskog himself was really tired when the first baby came into the family.

Vidjeskog wants to talk more about how fathers cope. That's why he founded a father's group in Pietarsaari. The group is attended by fathers who talk about the problems and joys of a father's life.

With the Father of the Year award, we want to support the father's role in the family. The Father of the Year award was awarded for the first time in 2006.

Father's Day is a younger holiday than Mother's Day. In many Finnish families, Father's Day started to be celebrated about 50 years ago. Mother's Day has been celebrated for about 100 years.

On Mother's Day, the president gives badges of honor to mothers who have done a good parenting job. This Father's Day, President **Alexander Stubb** promised that next year he will start giving badges of honor to fathers as well.

The importance of Father's Day has grown because the importance of the father in the family is supported. It is important for the child that he has a good relationship with his father as well.
