Now news from Kela.

Kela has a lot of sensitive information about people, which is why data security is important.

Kela's IT Director **Nina Nissilä** says that data security will continue to be good even if the data is transferred abroad. For example, the country where the data is located will be kept secret.

Initially, information on military allowances, survivor pensions and rehabilitation allowance will be transferred to the cloud service.

The change will begin in 2027.
