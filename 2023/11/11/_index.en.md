A corona expert says that citizens do not need to worry, even though the risk of infection is now high in Finland. Asko Järvinen, chief physician of infectious diseases, says that the protection of vaccinations and infected corona is good.

The new corona virus type EG5, or Eris, causes a disease that resembles influenza more than before. The fever can still be severe.

Intensive care professor Matti Reinikainen says that the trend is nevertheless worrying. Currently, there are a total of almost 30 patients in intensive care due to the corona virus. It is as much as in the spring and winter of 2022 during the pandemic. In a pandemic, the disease spread worldwide.

The content of the video application Tiktok can start to worsen depression surprisingly quickly, according to Yle's test.

Yle created the profile and picture of a depressed 13-year-old girl on Tiktok with the help of artificial intelligence. Tiktok quickly started showing videos with content related to depression, the idealization of thinness, and even suicide.

The leading psychologist of the non-governmental organization Mieli ry, Frans Horneman, says that the videos are harmful to the mental health of vulnerable groups.

Tiktok has 1.5 million users in Finland. Most are young people.

There is an extensive article about the test at yle.fi.

Men's friendship needs more men. Male friends are friends for children who do not have a relationship with their father or who have a weak relationship.

Men's friend activities are organized by Pienperheyhdistys in 6 localities. About 250 volunteers are involved.

About 110,000 children live with their mother, says Statistics Finland.

Most often, the child and the male friend meet 2 to 4 times a month. The friends decide for themselves what they will do at the meetings.

Volunteers are given 15 hours of training.

### Nose day
