Trade logistics strike. Lapland shops. Snow in the south. Weather.

## Trade strikes

First, news about the labor market.

The trade logistics strike began this morning. The strike in warehouses is slowing down the movement of goods.

The service sector union PAM sought wage increases, but negotiations with employers failed to reach an agreement. PAM sought increases of 6 percent for this year and 4 percent for next year.

The strike is scheduled to last 3 days.

Negotiations will continue tomorrow, Tuesday. If no agreement is reached, a strike in stores will begin on Wednesday.

The strikes affect over 70,000 PAM members.

The logistics strike in the retail sector began this morning, and the strike in stores may begin on Wednesday.

The shops will not close completely during the strike. There will be no shortage of food or goods. The Finnish Trade Federation says that the shops are well prepared for the strike.

However, there may be longer lines in stores because there are fewer employees. Not all employees are unionized or on strike.

## Lapland shops

In Lapland, transport distances are long. That is why stores in Lapland have prepared for the strike in advance. More goods have been ordered in advance than normal.

\- I would say that you can be quite happy.

For example, in Kittil√§, preparations are affected by the winter holiday season.

There are a lot of domestic tourists in Lapland now, because today is the start of the southern Finnish ski holiday week. Lapland has many ski resorts.

## Snow for a skiing holiday in the south

Then about the snow in southern Finland.

In the south, the ski vacation began in snowy weather.

It snowed heavily yesterday in and around the capital city.

For example, 16 centimeters of snow fell in Harabacka, Porvoo, 12 centimeters in Kaisaniemi, Helsinki, and 10 centimeters in Kumpula, Helsinki.

A few centimeters of snow also fell in the southwestern part of the country.

## Weather

Light snow in the east. Sunny weather in the west.
