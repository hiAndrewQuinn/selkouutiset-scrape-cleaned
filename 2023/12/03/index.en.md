The war in Gaza continues. There was a pause in the war during the truce, but the truce ended on Friday.

Israel's military says it has carried out more than 400 strikes on Gaza since the ceasefire.

Many people have died in the attacks. Therefore, international organizations are demanding a new ceasefire in Gaza.

The battles in Gaza are between Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas.

Sleep is important. Now researchers say that sleep also strengthens learning.

When a person studies something, a memory imprint is created in the brain. During sleep, the memory trace is strengthened, because the brain continues to work at night as well.

So it seems that a good night's sleep is important when a person is studying new things.

### Advent Sunday
