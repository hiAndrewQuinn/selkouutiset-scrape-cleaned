Two elections were held in Finland last Sunday, regional elections and municipal elections. The elections elected new regional councils for welfare areas and municipal councils for municipalities.

In both elections, the Social Democrats (SDP) received the most votes. The Coalition Party came in second and the Centre Party came in third.

The Finns Party was the biggest loser in the elections. The Finns Party was 6th in both elections. It was also surpassed by the Left Alliance and the Greens.

## The number of women in councils increased

Women performed well in both elections.

More women than men were elected to regional councils.

A record number of women, almost 45 percent, were also elected to municipal councils.

In the Helsinki region, more and more people with an immigrant background were elected to municipal councils.

The average age of new councillors increased slightly. The average age of councillors in municipalities and regions is just over 51 years.

The work of the new municipal and regional councils will begin at the beginning of June.

## A record number of votes were rejected

Voter turnout in regional and municipal elections remained low. Just over half of those eligible to vote cast their votes.

Both elections also saw a record number of rejected votes, with a total of over 120,000 rejected votes.

Votes were rejected, for example, because voters mixed up their ballots for regional and municipal elections.

The Ministry of Justice intends to investigate how voters can be better advised and assisted at the polling station in the future.
