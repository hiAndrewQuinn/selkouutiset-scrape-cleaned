Income support applications. Technology in elderly care. The art of HUS. Saturday's weather.

## Income support applications

First, the topic is Kela.

Kela's income support decisions are criticized.

The Parliamentary Ombudsperson now receives more complaints about income support decisions than in previous years. The ombudsman supervises the activities of the authorities.

Many applicants for income support say that they have given Kela all the explanations, but Kela asks for them again. It seems that Kela has not read the previous papers.

Kela's operation is criticized.

The cause of the problems is probably a big rush.

There is so much work now that Kela's benefits handlers are not allowed to take Christmas vacation this year.

## Technology in elderly care

Then the topic is elderly care.

Technology will soon be an important part of elderly care.

For example, in Pietarsaari, the technology has already entered home care for the elderly.

Gunn-Britt and Peter Sahlsten have a medicine machine.

Here, the nurse still verifies via a remote connection that they have taken the medication.

The Sahlstenes still cook themselves, but food vending machines are also coming to care for the elderly.

Technology will soon be an important part of elderly care.

However, it is important that the elderly are also visited by the right person, says nurse Katja Ahlvik.

## The art of HUS

Then the topic is art.

Art also affects health.

Helsinki Art Hall now presents art that belongs to Helsinki University Hospital HUS.

HUS owns around 6,000 works of art. 200 of them are now on display in Taidehall.

Usually, the artworks are, for example, on the walls of HUS hospitals and laboratories.

Art affects health.

Research shows that art improves people's well-being.

In hospitals, patients' symptoms decrease when they see art. They even live longer.

The Helsinki Art Gallery exhibition continues until January 5.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will snow a little in the north. In the rest of the country, it's raining, that is, it's not raining.

The sun shines in the southern and central parts of the country. It's freezing all over the country.
