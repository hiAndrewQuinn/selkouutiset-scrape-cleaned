## Social Democratic Party

The most popular party in municipal and regional elections is the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

The SDP's municipal election support is approximately 21 percent and the regional election support is approximately 22 percent.

The SDP's popularity has increased since the previous municipal elections.

The SDP is an opposition party, meaning it is not in the government.

## Coalition Party

The second most popular party in municipal and regional elections is the National Coalition Party.

The Coalition Party's support is almost 20 percent in both elections. The Coalition Party's popularity has decreased slightly since the previous municipal elections.

The National Coalition Party is the governing party and the Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** is also from the National Coalition Party.

The poll was conducted for Yle by the research firm Taloustutkimus.

Research director **Tuomo Turja** says that undecided voters are thinking more carefully than before about which party they will vote for.

That is why the SDP and the Coalition Party are losing votes to small parties and small groups.

## Downtown

The third most popular party in municipal and regional elections is the Centre Party.

The Center's municipal election support is over 15 percent and regional election support is over 19 percent.

The Center Party is an opposition party, meaning it is not in government.

Support for the Center Party has increased slightly since the previous municipal elections.

Research director Tuomo Turja says that supporters of the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party in particular have switched to supporting the center.

## Finns Party

The fourth most popular party in municipal and regional elections is the Finns Party. The Finns Party is the governing party.

Support for the Finns Party is now just under 13 percent in municipal elections and just under 11 percent in regional elections.

Support for the Finns Party has decreased since the previous municipal elections.

## Smaller parties

Among the smaller parties, support for both the Left Alliance and the Greens has decreased slightly.

Support for the Finnish Communist Party, the Christian Democrats, the New Movement and other parties has grown.
