A nuclear weapons exercise. Smartphone in traffic. Theme parks. Weather.

## NATO nuclear weapons exercise

First, we will talk about the nuclear weapons exercise.

For the first time, Finland is participating in the NATO nuclear weapons exercise.

The exercise starts today and will last for two weeks.

The exercise takes place in the airspace of Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark.

It includes machines from 13 different countries.

For the first time, Finland is participating in a NATO nuclear weapons exercise.

The exercise does not involve real nuclear weapons, but practice weapons.

## Smartphone in traffic

Then the topic is smartphone use in traffic.

The police want to control the use of smartphones in traffic even more strictly.

The police say that especially young drivers often fiddle with their phones while driving. It weakens traffic safety.

The police say that the so-called tin policemen may be able to monitor the use of the phone as well.

Tin police officers can film drivers who fiddle with their smartphones while driving.

The tin police's phone monitoring will be tried maybe already in a year.

## Theme parks

Then we go to the playground.

Cities are renewing children's playgrounds.

Playgrounds are now being turned into theme parks, where people will play even further afield.

For example, there is Uppo-Nalle park in Kuopio, Seikkailupuisto park in Turku and Pikku Kakkonen park in Tampere.

These pictures are from the new playground in Ruoholahti, Helsinki. The theme of this park is computers.

The city of Helsinki plans to build a total of 7 theme playgrounds in different parts of the city. The theme of the next park may be the sea.

But what do the experts say about the computer park? Here's how Alayna and Hibaq:

\- I come here every day because it's so nice.

\- I also go here every day - and I like being here because there is that big slide here and then that phone is still ringing.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Tuesday, the weather will be cloudy in a large part of the country.

The sun shines in the west and north. In the east it may rain and it is cloudier.

The temperature is below 10 degrees throughout the country.
