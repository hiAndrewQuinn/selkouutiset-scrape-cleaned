## Substance abuse treatment and benefits

Then the topic is new substance abuse treatment.

Studies show that rewards are an effective way to treat drug addiction.

The client can receive a reward if an agreed goal is achieved. The goal can be, for example, a clean drug test or completing homework.

The reward can be, for example, a gift card, hygiene product, small item or candy.
