## Security of ministers

First, news about the security of ministers.

The prime minister of Slovakia was shot on Wednesday, and now Finland is also paying a lot of attention to the safety of ministers.

Finns are used to ministers moving freely among the people.

However, the State Council's security director Ahti Kurvinen says that Finnish government ministers have recently received more threats than before.

That is why ministers have even canceled participation in events.

## Rautatintor metro station

Then the news about the Helsinki metro.

Rautatintor metro station is closed in the summer.

The reason is the renovation, which will improve the metro station's fire safety.

Rautatintor metro station will be closed on June 3.

After that, metro trains run from Espoo only as far as Kamppi and from East Helsinki only as far as the University of Helsinki.

Passengers can travel between the Kamppi and University of Helsinki metro stations by tram.

The Rautatintor metro station will reopen at the beginning of September.
