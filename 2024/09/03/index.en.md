## Real estate transactions by Russians in Finland

First, news about security.

The government proposes that real estate transactions by Russians be banned in Finland.

Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen told about it yesterday.

A property is, for example, a house and its plot.

Häkkänen says that Russia can use real estate, for example, to secretly collect information that can interfere with Finland's security.

Häkkänen estimates that there are around 3,500 properties in Finland whose owners are Russian. The government does not want the number to increase.

That is why the government proposes that real estate transactions by Russians be banned in Finland.

However, the ban does not apply to dual Finnish citizens or Russians who have a permanent residence permit in Finland.

If the parliament approves the government's proposal, the ban will probably come into effect next spring.

## Teaching different mother tongues in Helsinki

Then the subject is mother tongue teaching.

Primary schools in Helsinki teach their mother tongue in 50 different languages.

This is where the mother tongue lesson in Japanese is going.

The children say that it is difficult to remember Japanese letters. That's why writing is hard.

Teacher Akane Suzuki says that the school needs to expand the children's vocabulary. If children only speak their mother tongue at home, their vocabulary will not grow.

It is also important for children to meet other children who have the same mother tongue.

Primary schools in Helsinki teach their mother tongue in 50 different languages.

However, it is difficult to find teachers.

Currently, Helsinki is looking for Cantonese, Lingala, Wolof and Icelandic teachers, for example.

## Rautatintor metro station

Great news about the Helsinki metro.

Rautatintor metro station is open again. The metro station was opened yesterday.

Rautatintor metro station was closed for 3 months due to renovation.

The metro station's fire safety in particular has been improved.

Now traffic at the Rautatintori metro station runs normally again.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The sun will shine tomorrow.

The whole country is cloudy, meaning it doesn't rain.

The day is warm: the temperature is over 20 degrees in most of Finland.

It is hot in the south and east, i.e. more than 25 degrees.
