European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen nominates Henna Virkkus as Finland's commissioner. Virkkunen, from Kokoumus, is a member of the EU Parliament for the third term.

Each EU country has 1 commissioner in the commission. There are 27 member countries in the EU.

The Commission implements European Union policy. For example, the Commission makes legislative proposals and supervises the EU economy.

## Virkkunen's task is significant

Finland's Henna Virkkunen begins to handle matters related to technology, security and democracy.

Virkkus will also become vice-chairman of the commission. The commission has a total of 6 vice-chairmen.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo says that Virkkunen's position is exactly what Finland wanted.

For example, technological and digital security is important.

Financial security means, for example, who is allowed to invest in Europe.

## Democracy and the rule of law

Virkkusen also includes the development of democracy. It includes rule of law development. EU countries' funding is affected by how countries respect the rule of law.

The rule of law respects democracy and people's basic rights, and every person has equal protection before the law.

Virkkunen's duties may also include border security and immigration reform. In the reform, decisions are made on EU immigration matters, i.e. who can enter the territory of the Union.

## Virkkunen has been in politics for a long time

In Finland, Virkkus has held many positions of trust.

He was elected to the Parliament for the first time in 2007. Virkkunen has been, for example, Minister of Education and Minister of Municipalities and Administration.

The European Parliament still has to approve the nominations of the commissioners-designate.
