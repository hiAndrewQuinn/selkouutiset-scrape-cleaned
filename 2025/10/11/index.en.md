The Nobel Prize is based on the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish inventor. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901.

The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

Machado is being rewarded for his long work promoting the democratic rights of the Venezuelan people.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee thanks Machado for this work. Machado fights for a just and peaceful transition to democracy.

Venezuela used to be a fairly democratic and prosperous country that was doing well. However, it has become a brutal and authoritarian state.

The majority of Venezuelans live in poverty.

The Nobel Committee says that the Venezuelan opposition is being systematically repressed.

The opposition chose María Corina Machado as its joint presidential candidate in last year's elections.

However, he was not allowed to run. Nicolás Maduro was able to win a third term as president.

Machado has been forced to live in hiding, but wanted to remain in Venezuela. The Nobel Committee emphasizes that he has inspired the Venezuelan people.
