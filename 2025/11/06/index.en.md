Party support. Working life. Leandro Erlich. Friday's weather.

## Party support

First, news about politics.

Yle has again asked Finns which party they support.

The most popular party is the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP is supported by over 25 percent of Finns.

The SDP is an opposition party, meaning it is not in the government.

The second most popular party is the ruling coalition, the Coalition Party, with 19 percent support.

The National Coalition Party is the governing party and the Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** is also from the National Coalition Party.

The third most popular party is the Finns Party, with support for the Finns Party at almost 15 percent.

The Finns Fundamentalists are also a government party.

The fourth most popular party is the Centre Party. The Centre Party's support is almost 14 percent. The Centre Party is not in the government.

Yle has again asked Finns which party they support.

There have been no changes in the order of popularity of the parties.

## Working life

Now some news from working life.

Many Finns are considering quitting their jobs. The reasons are work overload and poor management.

A new study shows that almost 40 percent of Finns are considering quitting their jobs.

**Eeva Förbom** was a teacher of English and Swedish at the University of Applied Sciences.

He resigned in September because the teaching groups grew large and the work became lonely.

Much of the teaching took place remotely through online courses, so Förbom did not meet many students or other teachers.

*"I sit largely remotely, working from home, and even then, on the few days I'm on campus, I don't see many of my colleagues."*

Many Finns are considering quitting their jobs.
