## Robert Francis Prevost

The new pope is the American Robert Francis Prevost. He chose the papal name Leo XIV.

Experts say the election of an American as pope is a big surprise.

The general idea is that Americans should not be elected popes because the US is already the most influential country in the world. The idea has been that the US should not gain too much power in church affairs.

Prevost is not exactly a typical American, however. He has been in church service in Peru for about 20 years.

He has US citizenship and also Peruvian citizenship.

Prevost has also lived in the Vatican. In recent years, he has headed the office in Rome responsible for the appointment of bishops.

Therefore, Prevost is also very familiar with the operations of the Vatican, the Catholic Church administration.

## Moderate Pope

Many experts estimate that Prevost, or Pope Leo XIV, will continue the line of the previous Pope Francis.

Prevost is a moderate and conciliatory leader. Prevost supports many of Francis' reforms, such as combating climate change and helping refugees.

Prevost also likes modesty. He wants church leaders to be close to the people and believers.

However, Prevost's attitude towards sexual minorities has been more critical than that of Pope Francis. However, it is not yet known what the attitude will be now that Prevost is Pope Leo XIV.

Although Prevost is American, he does not share the values of the administration of US President **Donald Trump**. Prevost has also criticized representatives of the US administration.
