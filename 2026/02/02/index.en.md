Social assistance. Finland's gold reserves. Air traffic control. Weather.

## Conditions for social assistance

First, support policy.

The conditions for social assistance have become stricter. Now, the recipient of the assistance must demonstrate more precisely that they need the support.

First, you need to apply for some other support, such as student financial aid and unemployment benefits.

If the regulations are not followed, social assistance may be cut.

Social assistance is paid if your own income is not enough to cover basic living needs and your savings have been used up.

Last year, over a billion euros in social assistance were paid. People have been applying for social assistance more than before because other benefits have been cut.

The conditions for social assistance have become stricter.

The goal is that social assistance is paid for only a short time or not at all.

## Finland's gold reserves

The Bank of Finland holds 44 tons of gold. Its market value is currently over 6 billion euros.

Finland's gold is in half-kilo bars in the vaults of various central banks.

The value of Finnish gold is at a historically high level.

Finland is not considering withdrawing gold from the US. In addition to Finland, Finnish gold is stored in England, Switzerland and Sweden.

## Hearings

Then about the hearing.

The race to fly to the Moon is intensifying.

The US will soon send a probe and crew to orbit the Moon. China is testing a giant rocket.

It is not yet known who will reach the Moon first, the USA or China.

The race to fly to the Moon is heating up. The last time a man flew to the Moon was over 50 years ago.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The rainy weather continues throughout the country.

Cloudiness will vary tomorrow.
