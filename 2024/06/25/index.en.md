Will Rydman. Equality at festivals. NHL. Weather.

## Wille Rydman

First, the topic is the Minister of Economic Affairs, Wille Rydman.

Basic Finnish Minister of Economic Affairs Wille Rydman won the confidence of the parliament. Rydman received the vote of confidence 92--76.

Helsingin Sanomat reported 2 years ago that Rydman has mistreated young women. Rydman later accused Helsingin Sanom and the women of lying. In the opinion of the opposition, this is not appropriate behavior for the minister.

So now Rydman got the parliament's trust.
