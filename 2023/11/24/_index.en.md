On the border between Finland and Russia, Friday was calm.

Three people came from Russia to the Raja-Joosep border station in Inari. They were Yemenis.

Raja-Jooseppi is far in the north. It is now the only border crossing on the eastern border that is open.

Finland has closed other border crossings. They stay closed at least until Christmas.

The reason is that Russia has directed more and more migrants to Finland.

### Israel-Hamas ceasefire

In the Middle East, a cease-fire between Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas has begun in Gaza. It will take at least four days. During the ceasefire, Israel and Hamas do not fight.

During the break, Israel allows trucks to Gaza to take, for example, medicine, food and gasoline.

During the ceasefire, Israel releases Palestinian prisoners and Hamas releases Israeli prisoners.

The Gaza war began in early October when Hamas attacked Israel. Israel has since bombed Gaza. The situation of people in Gaza is really bad.

### Evicting

Most Finns think that evicting a tenant from an apartment is too difficult. This is what a new survey says.

A court decision is required to evict a tenant. Only an authority can carry out an eviction. The law gives the tenant a lot of protection.

The situation is difficult for the owner of the apartment if, for example, the tenant does not pay the rent.

More than 80 percent of Finns think that eviction is too complicated today.

### The Sami people

In Finland, discrimination against the Sámi is being studied today and in the past. The truth commission is investigating the matter.

The commission collects the Sámi's experiences of the Finnish state and authorities.

In the past, Finland did not accept the culture of the Sami people. They wanted to change the Sámi people to be the same as other Finns.

The treatment of the Sámi caused a lot of grief. The Sámi are the indigenous people of Finland.
