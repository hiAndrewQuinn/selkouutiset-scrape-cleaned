Minister of the Interior. Bruises. Rubik's cube. Weather.

## Minister of the Interior

First, news about politics.

Interior Minister **Mari Rantanen** will be temporarily out of the minister's job.

The reason is the serious illness of Rantanen's child.

Rantanen is away from the minister's job until the end of the year.

Rantanen says that he likes the minister's job, but the child is more important.

*"I think that as much as I love this job, I love my child even more."*

Interior Minister Mari Rantanen will temporarily leave the minister's job.

At that time, the work of the Minister of the Interior was handled by the Minister of Transport and Communications **Lulu Ranne**.

Lulu Ranne handles the work of two ministers, which means that there will be no new person in the board.

Both Rantanen's and Rannee's parties are basic Finns.

## River pearl mussels, i.e. raw

Now news about nature.

Perhaps a serious environmental crime has occurred in Suomussalmi.

Thousands of river pearl mussels have died because a forest machine has run over them in the Hukkajoki.

This video was shot by a biologist who saw a forest machine.

Forest machines may have been driven across the river many times.

Some of the shells have been left under the machine. Some of the mussels have died because sand has entered them.

They are trying to save Raakku in Hukkajoki. They are moved to a new location in the river.

Raakku is an endangered mussel species. That's why it's pacified. Hukkajoki is one of the few places where skunks live. Forest machines may not be driven across the river.

Perhaps a serious environmental crime has occurred in Suomussalmi.

The police are investigating the destruction in Hukkajoki.
