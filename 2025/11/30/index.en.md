## Black Friday sale week and online shopping

The topic of this week's news is Black Friday sales week and online shopping.

Black Friday is a big sale week that has brought lots of deals to stores and online stores.

We will now talk about the new operating models of online shopping and why you need to be careful when shopping.

## Dropshipping

Online stores have introduced many new ways to sell products.

One of these is dropshipping. In this model, the goods are sold by an online store that looks Finnish, but the store's warehouse and shipping are abroad. Often, they are in China.

The buyer thinks he is ordering the product from Finland, but in reality the goods come from abroad.

If the product needs to be returned, it will have to be returned abroad. This can be slow and expensive.

## Marketplace

Another new way of operating for online stores is the marketplace.

The website of a large Finnish online store may have products that are sold by another company.

For example, a department store's page may have products that are sold by a company other than the department store.

The customer thinks they are buying from a familiar store, but in reality the product comes from a different seller.

Then customer service and returns will also be handled by a different company than the one you are familiar with.

## Fake online stores and package scams

Black Friday sale week increases scams because there are a lot of people out shopping.

There are also fake online stores and scam websites online. They lure buyers with big discounts, but the products may be bad or not available at all.

Package scams are also increasing.

In package scams, the scammer sends a message to the person that a package is coming.

The link in the message takes you to a scam page where they try to get, for example, bank account details.

Real transport companies don't ask for people's bank details.

## Be careful when shopping online

Authorities advise that when shopping online, you should always check who is selling the product and where the product is being shipped from.

It's especially worth being careful if there are cheap clothes, crafts, or electronics on sale.

Many stores advertise big discounts. The discounts are not always real.

Product prices may have been increased before Black Friday, which is why discounts can be given now.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was Black Friday and online shopping.

Online stores have new operating models that make it difficult to see from whom a customer is buying a product.

During sale weeks, parcel scams, for example, also increase.

Product prices may have been increased before the discount campaign, which is why the discounts appear large.

This was a news week in plain Finnish, see you again. See you later!
