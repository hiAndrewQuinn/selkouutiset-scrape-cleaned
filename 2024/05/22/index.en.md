Euro election exam. Reversal law. Weather

## Euro election exam

First, the topic is the European elections.

Yesterday, Yle's exit exam was attended by the chairman of the Green Party, Sofia Virta, the chairman of the center, Annika Saarikko, and the chairman of the Left Alliance, Li Andersson.

They discussed, for example, how some European Union countries support a lot of their own country's companies.

The chairmen said that the small country Finland cannot compete with the EU's major powers in the amount of state aid.

They say that solutions must be sought from, for example, the EU's common funding opportunities.

Yle's European election exams continue today. There are always chairmen of 3 different parties.

The European elections are in June.

## Law of exceptions

The government has given the parliament a proposal on the so-called conversion law.

The exception law is intended to prevent the influence of another state on Finland in a situation where immigrants are exploited.

With the help of the law, the government can decide to limit the reception of asylum applications at the Finnish border.

The law still requires the approval of the parliament.

## Criticism of the translation law

The government has issued a proposal on the so-called conversion law. Many experts oppose the exception law.

Martti Koskenniemi, professor emeritus of international law, says that the bill violates the prohibition of refoulement, which is related to human rights treaties.

You cannot complain about the return.

Assistant professor Anitta Kynsilehto says that the asylum situation at the border is too much the responsibility of the border guards. However, the tasks require a long education and versatile language skills.

The ruling party RKP and the opposition SDP, the center and the greens are also concerned about human rights.

The emergency law requires the support of the opposition, because the adoption of the law requires a five-sixths majority in the parliament.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

It is mostly sunny. At night, especially in the north, frost can occur on the surface of the earth. During the day, the temperature is 18\...25 degrees.
