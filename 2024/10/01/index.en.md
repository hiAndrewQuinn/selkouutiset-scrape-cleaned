Middle East. Cable factory. Calligraphy. Weather.

## Middle East

First news from abroad.

New battles have started in the Middle East.

Israel has launched a ground attack on neighboring Lebanon. The extremist organization Hezbollah operates in Lebanon.

Israel is now attacking Hezbollah. Israel says Hezbollah terrorists are a threat to Israel's security.

New battles have started in the Middle East.

The battles between the Jewish Israel and the Islamic Hezbollah have intensified recently. They have carried out airstrikes against each other.

Last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike.

Now Israel has also started a ground attack on southern Lebanon.

## Cable factory

Then the economic news.

Things are going well at Pikkala Cable Factory in Kirkkonummi.

Marine cable is manufactured at the factory.

It is needed for offshore wind power. Submarine cables transport offshore wind power to the electricity grid.

A lot of offshore wind power is being built around the world because it is clean energy. This is how it helps in the fight against climate change.

Pikkala Cable Factory is doing well.

Finnish know-how is needed because submarine cables must be durable. They must last many tens of years at a depth of up to 2 kilometers.

## Calligraphy

Then the subject of writing.

This is fiction.

Schoolchildren no longer have to learn calligraphy. The teaching of calligraphy stopped in schools 8 years ago.

However, these school children want to learn calligraphy voluntarily. Calligraphy is an optional subject for these students.

So this is fiction.

In calligraphy, the letters are attached to each other, and the letters have different shapes.

Calligraphy is of interest to schoolchildren, because many people think that calligraphy is beautiful.

\- Because it's a beautiful script and it's nice to write it.

\- I think it's great.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather in a large part of the country is cloudy, i.e. rainless.

It rains from time to time in the south.
