This week there was two news about government ministers.

The first ministerial news was that Minister of Social Affairs and Health **Kaisa Juuso** would resign from her ministerial position.

Juuso announced his resignation as minister on Thursday. He immediately went on sick leave.

## Munich Security Conference

The Munich Security Conference was held in Germany this weekend.

It is a major meeting that brings together world leaders and experts to discuss security.

Europe was nervous about what the US would say to Europe.

US Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** gave a speech that was conciliatory and calm.

Although Rubio's speech was conciliatory, he also had demands for Europe.

Rubio said that Europe must take more responsibility for defense.

Rubio also criticized Europe's immigration and climate policies.

## Asko and Sotka

Furniture stores Asko and Sotka were closed this week.

The reason is bankruptcy, i.e. running out of money.

Asko and Sotka are owned by a company called Indoor Group. It is no longer able to operate due to financial difficulties.

Bankruptcy is a bad thing for Asko and Sotka customers.

Many Finns have ordered and paid for furniture that is shipped from the factory.

Due to the bankruptcy, not all customers may receive this furniture.

It may also be that the bankruptcy estate does not have enough money to repay the payments.

It may take a long time to resolve the situation.
