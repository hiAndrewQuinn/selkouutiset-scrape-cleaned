The Finnish Red Cross, or SPR, is involved in the aid operation in Gaza. SPR sends a standby unit to Egypt.

There are 5 people in the standby unit. They make sure that international aid reaches Gaza from Egypt.

In addition, SPR gives 200,000 euros for aid work in Gaza and Israel.

The terrorist organization Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza about 3 weeks ago. That started a war in which many thousands of people have died.

The war has caused a lot of suffering for the people of Gaza. For example, they need food and medicine.

Gaza is located on the border between Israel and Egypt. Therefore, international aid to Gaza is transported through Egypt.

### Corona infections

Corona infections are increasing again in Finland.

Corona is a respiratory infection. Respiratory infections increase in the fall, when people are indoors again.

For example, in the Helsinki and Uusimaa region, the number of corona patients has increased. There are now 80 patients with corona infection in hospital.

A large part of the corona patients in hospitals are old.

That's why doctors say that people over 65 should get a booster vaccination against corona.

Corona booster vaccinations will start in different parts of Finland in November.

The corona vaccination can be taken at the same time as the autumn flu vaccination.

### Apartment prices
