Government tax decisions. Hockey. Nature. Weather.

## Government tax decisions

First, politics.

The opposition criticizes the government's tax decisions.

The government decided to reduce taxes on labor and businesses by about 2 billion euros. Opposition MPs say the decision is bad. The opposition wonders why the government is reducing taxes on high-income earners.

Finance Minister Riikka Purra says that taxes on low-income people will also be reduced. Purra believes that tax cuts will increase Finland's economic growth.

The opposition is criticizing the government's tax decisions. Experts also say that the effects of the decisions are uncertain. Finland will probably have to take on more debt.

## Ice hockey

Next, sports.

The Finnish Ice Hockey Championship finals begin today, Friday. The final will feature Kuopio KalPa and Lappeenranta SaiPa.

The Finnish championship is won by the team that wins 4 games first.

The first game of the final series will be played in Kuopio.

The Finnish Ice Hockey Championship finals begin tonight. A new team will win the Finnish Ice Hockey Championship this year. Kuopio's KalPa or Lappeenranta's SaiPa have never won the championship.

## Spring in nature

Now the topic is nature.

There are many signs of spring in nature now. In many places, spring is already here longer than it usually is by the end of April.

For example, swallows have already flown to Finland in large numbers. Most of them are in Southwest Finland, but swallows have also been spotted in Southeast Finland, among other places.

Plants also wake up as spring progresses. In southern Finland, many trees already have leaves.

The birch trees are also already showing some green color.

Nature expert Mikko Pöyhönen is enthusiastic:

\-*The willows and willows already have quite a bit of leaf. The birches are starting to have mouse ears. It's never in mid-April that a birch starts to have leaves. Yes, this is quite amazing in the plant world.*

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is breezy, meaning it's not raining. The sun is shining in many places. The weather is cold. It's freezing in the north.
