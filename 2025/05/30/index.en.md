Higher education. Surgery queues. School graduations. Weather.

## Higher education

First, some news about studying.

Finland wants to increase higher education.

More students are going from vocational schools to higher education than before.

Approximately 25 percent of students at the University of Applied Sciences have first attended a vocational school.

The share has grown slowly over the past 10 years. It supports Finland's goal of increasing higher education.

A common concern is that children do not learn enough basic things in primary school, which makes further education difficult.

Approximately 8,000 students drop out of higher education in the first year.

University studies require the ability to understand and write difficult texts.

This is what Minister of Education Anders Adlercreutz says.

*"It is perhaps a common concern in our school system now that, in my opinion, comprehensive school as it currently is does not offer or provide sufficient basic skills for everyone."*

## Cutting queues

Now the news about surgery queues

Surgery queues have started to shorten.

This patient has been waiting for surgery for almost a year. He has been experiencing severe pain in his face because a blood vessel is pressing on a nerve.

You may have to wait a long time to get access to such surgery, as the disease is not life-threatening.

Urgent illnesses always come first in the surgery queue, which is why the waiting time can last for many years.

The coronavirus pandemic and nurses' strikes have increased the number of surgeries. The aging population is also increasing the need for surgeries.

Now the surgery queues have started to get shorter.

## School graduations

Finally, news about the end of school.

Tomorrow, Saturday, we will celebrate the end of school holidays.

The students receive their certificates and their summer vacation begins.

Approximately 63,000 ninth grade students graduate from comprehensive school.

Approximately 25,400 new high school graduates will graduate from upper secondary schools. That is approximately 600 more than in the spring of last year.

Students graduate from vocational education throughout the year, a total of approximately 70,000 per year.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be rainy on Saturday.

It can rain almost all over the country. There will be dry weather in the south and north.

In the south, the temperature is around 17 degrees, while elsewhere the temperature is below 15 degrees.
