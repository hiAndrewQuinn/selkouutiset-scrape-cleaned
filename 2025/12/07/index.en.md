## The government's new climate plan

The topic of this week's news is the government's new climate plan.

The Finnish government published a plan this week aimed at reducing emissions and combating climate change.

We will now tell you what was decided in the plan and what it means in Finland.

## Carbon neutral

Finland's goal is to be carbon neutral by 2035.

Carbon neutrality means that Finland does not emit more emissions into the air than it can remove, for example, through forests.

The government also wants Finland to use more clean energy, i.e. wind power and solar power.

## Electric cars

One important issue is the electrification of transport.

The aim is for the state to support the purchase of electric cars and provide support when an old car is replaced with a low-emission car.

Low-income people receive support for purchasing an electric car.

The scrapping bonus will also be continued, meaning the state will support if a person trades in a really old car for a new one.

## Corporate support

The government wants companies to invest in Finland and produce cleaner energy.

That's why companies receive subsidies for new technologies and carbon capture.

Finland wants clean energy to become Finland's strength.

## Forests

The state of forests is Finland's biggest climate problem.

Previously, forests sequestered a lot of carbon, but now forests emit more carbon dioxide than they sequester.

Reasons include, for example, increased logging and slower tree growth.

The government wants forests to be grown denser and older than they are now. The government also wants to support forest planting and fertilization.

## Criticism

Many experts say the government's plan is not yet enough.

The chairman of the climate panel, **Jyri Seppälä**, says that the condition of forests needs to be improved more and that the logging rates are too high.

Experts hope for more information and clearer decisions.

Minister of the Environment and Climate **Sari Multala** says that Finland is committed to the goals.

Minister Multala says that new measures can be taken if the need arises.

Many aspects of the climate plan still need more funding and more information about the impacts.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was the government's new climate plan.

Its goal is to reduce emissions, increase clean energy, and manage forests better.

However, experts say that more action is needed to achieve the goals.
