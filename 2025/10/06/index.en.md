Defence Forces. Rental apartments. Snow storage. Weather.

## Drones and mines

First, news about the Finnish Defence Forces, or the army.

The army begins training conscripts for drone operations.

Drones have disrupted air traffic in many European countries in recent weeks. Drones have also been spotted near military targets.

Finland has prepared for similar harassment.

Commander of the Army Pasi Välimäki says that Finland has systems to detect and repel drones.

Conscripts will also begin training in the use of anti-personnel mines.

Conscripts are taught to clear and place anti-personnel mines.

Anti-personnel mines are explosives that can be placed on the ground or in water. They explode when a person or vehicle comes close.

## Rental apartments

Then there's the matter of rental apartments.

Many people are now looking for new and cheaper rental housing.

Approximately 20 percent of tenants who receive housing benefit are looking for cheaper rental housing.

Some of them have already been able to move to a cheaper apartment, according to a survey by the OP Bank Group.

Many people are forced to look for cheaper rental housing because housing subsidies have been tightened.

## Snow storage

Finally, the topic is snow.

The use of snowpack is increasing in Lapland tourism.

Snow storage refers to snow that was collected the previous winter and stored over the summer for the following autumn.

With the help of stored snow, for example, ski slopes can be opened as early as October, even though winter has not even started yet.

The use of snowpack extends the tourist season in Lapland.

The Ruka and Levi ski resorts have already opened the first slopes using stored snow.

Routes are also built from stored snow, for example for dog sledding.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Tuesday, light rain will fall across much of the country.

The temperature is between +6 and 10 degrees, it can be warmer in the south.
