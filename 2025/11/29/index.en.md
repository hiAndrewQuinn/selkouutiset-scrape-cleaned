## Unnecessary treatments and medications in Finland

This time, the topic of the news week is unnecessary treatments and medications in Finland.

In Finland, patients are often given treatments and medications that are of no benefit. Unnecessary treatments cost money and burden the healthcare system.

We will now tell you more about the problems of unnecessary treatments and how the situation can be improved.

## Antibiotics and X-rays

Around 20–30 percent of healthcare interventions do not help the patient, according to a new study by physician and researcher **Aleksi Raudasoja** at the University of Helsinki.

Unnecessary treatments include, for example, antibiotic courses for a common cold or back X-rays when there is no real reason for it.

Doctors also prescribe medication for mild insomnia or depression, although medications are not always helpful.

Unnecessary treatments cause harm. For example, unnecessary X-rays expose people to excess radiation.

Unnecessary treatments take up a lot of time and money, costing up to hundreds of millions of euros a year.

## Patient's wishes

Doctors sometimes prescribe unnecessary treatments because the patient wants medicine or testing.

If the doctor does not prescribe the desired treatment, the patient will be disappointed or require further clarification.

Many doctors are afraid of making a mistake if they don't provide treatment just to be on the safe side.

More than 80 percent of doctors say that unnecessary treatments and excessive testing are a big problem.

Not all patients receive the necessary treatment, and some people are left without help.

## Chatting and a familiar doctor

**Jukka Mattila**, director of the Finnish Medical Association, says that a permanent and familiar doctor reduces unnecessary treatments.

When a doctor knows the patient, treatment decisions are made calmly.

Researcher Raudasoja also says that the best way to reduce unnecessary treatments is to talk to the patient. Patients should be informed about the potential harms and benefits of treatments.

Researcher Raudasoja says that medical training needs to be developed so that treatments are only given when they are truly beneficial.

Reducing unnecessary treatments saves money and time and improves healthcare.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was unnecessary treatments and medications in Finland.

In Finland, a lot of research is done and medications are prescribed that do not benefit the patient.

Unnecessary treatments can be harmful and burden healthcare.

Experts say more discussion is needed between patient and doctor and training for doctors.
