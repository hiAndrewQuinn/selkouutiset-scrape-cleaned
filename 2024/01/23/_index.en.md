Kindergarten strike. ADHD. The young people of Myyrmäki. Weather.

## Kindergarten strike

First, the strike news.

Kindergartens in the Helsinki region will be on strike next week.

The workers' unions announced the strike today.

The strike lasts 2 days. Daycare workers will not work on Wednesday and Thursday next week.

The strike does not apply to, for example, family day care or care assistance services.

Kindergartens in the Helsinki region will be on strike next week.

With the help of the strike, the trade unions oppose the government's policy.

The government wants to influence, for example, how large salary increases are made in Finland.

In the opinion of the trade unions, the workers in the nursing sector, who have low salaries, suffer from it.

(Clarification: The trade unions later said that the strike also applies to family day care.)

## ADHD in children and adolescents

Then the topic is ADHD, i.e. activity and attention disorder.

The number of children and young people with ADHD has increased.

In 2022, more than 8 percent of boys and more than 3 percent of girls had an ADHD diagnosis.

The number of ADHD cases has increased rapidly.

One reason for this is that doctors are better able to find cases of ADHD than before.

In addition, the environment has changed so that children's restlessness increases.

Children don't always get enough sleep and exercise, but they use their smartphones too much.

## The young people of Myyrmäki

Finally, news from Vantaa.

In Vantaa's Myyrmäki, it has been possible to reduce the violence experienced by young people.

The Myyrmäki mosque is also involved in the work.

The imam of the mosque, Sharmarke Said Aw-Musse, says that the mothers of the young people wished for more spaces and hobbies for the young people.

That's why the Myyrmäki mosque and organizations started organizing activities for young people. The city of Vantaa has supported the work.

With the help of cooperation, Myyrmäki has succeeded in reducing youth violence.

*- We want to promote this society and give young people from different backgrounds a message that they belong to this society and Finland is their country.*
