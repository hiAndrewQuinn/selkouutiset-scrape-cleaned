Prime Minister Petteri Orpo visited China this week. During the trip, Orpo met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as the Chinese Prime Minister and Minister of Commerce.

One of the purposes of the trip was to promote Finnish exports to China. That is why Orpo was accompanied by representatives from over 20 Finnish companies. These included food companies Fazer and Valio, elevator company Kone, and Metso, which manufactures mining equipment.

Orpo hoped that China would take action to give Finnish companies more free access to the Chinese market.

Orpo says the trip was a success, with a total of 11 trade agreements signed during it.

Several Western leaders have visited China recently.

In addition to the Finnish Prime Minister, the President of France and the Prime Ministers of Ireland, Canada and Britain have visited China, for example. The German Chancellor is expected to visit Beijing next.

Visitors are interested in China's large markets.

Interest in China has also grown because the US has become an unreliable trading partner. While other countries want to facilitate trade, the US president threatens new tariffs.

## The EU has made big trade agreements

The European Union is also looking for new trading partners. There are no fewer than six trade negotiations underway.

During the first half of the year, the EU has concluded trade agreements with countries such as Indonesia and the South American Mercosur countries. The Mercosur countries are Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.

This week also saw the signing of a free trade agreement between the EU and India, creating a market of two billion people.

Heli Siikaluoma, an expert at the Confederation of Finnish Industries, says that EU trade agreements also open up major export opportunities for Finnish companies.

## Repetition

Let's repeat a little.

Finland and many other countries are looking for new trading partners.

Leaders from many countries are now visiting China, as China's large market is of interest.

The EU has signed many important trade agreements during the first half of the year, from which Finland can also benefit.
