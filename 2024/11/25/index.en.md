Climate meeting. Danger of flooding. Winter feeding of birds. Tuesday's weather.

## Climate meeting

First, climate change.

The UN climate conference is over. The meeting was in Baku, Azerbaijan.

The theme of the meeting was the fight against climate change. People must reduce the use of oil and gas if climate change is to be slowed down.

At the meeting, it was decided that 300 billion dollars per year will be set aside for climate action.

Money is collected from rich countries and given to poor countries. In this way, poor countries can prevent climate change and develop ways to cope with the effects of climate change.

Climate change causes droughts and floods, especially in the poor countries of the south.

The UN climate conference is over.

In Finland, many are disappointed with the decisions of the meeting. For example, environmental organizations say that 300 billion dollars a year is not enough to fight climate change.

## Danger of flooding

Then the subject of the flood.

There may be floods in southern and western Finland.

Especially in Ostrobothnia, there are warnings about floods that can even damage buildings.

It snowed last week, but now the weather is warming up. That's why the snow melts, and at the same time it rains.

There were problems in the north over the weekend. The water level in Tornionjoki rose because ice blocked the river.

## Winter feeding of birds

Then the topic is birds.

Now is a good time to start winter feeding the birds.

Jan Södersved feeds the birds every winter. He is from Birdlife Finland.

Good food for birds is seeds and nuts, says Södersved. The birds must be fed throughout the winter if feeding is started.

Now is a good time to start winter feeding the birds.

Finns, however, feed birds less than before.

Many are afraid that rats and mice will come to the feeding place.

That won't happen if you take care that there is no food in the country, says Södersved.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow the weather will be cloudy.

It rains in the south and east. The temperature is around 5 degrees.

It is snowing and raining in the north. The temperature is between +5 and -5 degrees.

The wind will be moderate tomorrow.
