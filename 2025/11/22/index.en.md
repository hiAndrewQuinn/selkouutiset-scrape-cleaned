There has been a lot of talk this week about the Western Railway. The Western Railway is a train line planned between Helsinki and Turku.

If the Western Railway is built, the travel time between Helsinki and Turku will be shortened. Along the Western Railway, you can get from Helsinki to Turku in just over an hour. Currently, the train journey takes about two hours.

## The expensive price of the Western Railway

Not everyone supports the western railway, as its construction costs a lot of money.

The first phase of the Western Railway will cost around 1.3 billion euros. Municipalities will pay 400 million euros and the state will pay the same amount. The railway company plans to borrow the remaining money, over 500 million euros.

Opponents of the Western Railway say that it is not worth building a new rail connection now, when money is tight anyway.

## Decisions in the coming weeks
