Middle East. Schools. Circus life. Weather.

## Israel-Iran conflict

First, news about the situation in the Middle East.

Israel says it will respond to Iran's strike. Iran carried out a large-scale air attack on Israel on Saturday.

The Israeli military leadership held a meeting on Monday. Israel says it will respond to Iran's strike.

Many world leaders are worried about the situation. If Israel strikes back at Iran, there could be a full-scale war in the Middle East.

Lieutenant Colonel **Juha Mäkelä** estimates that a cycle of revenge may begin if Israel attacks Iran.

*"It is difficult with military actions to make such a strike that would not lead to a cycle of revenge again."*

Many European leaders appeal to Israel that Israel does not strike Iran. The USA also says that the USA will not support Israel if Israel attacks Iran.

## Schools

Now news about schools.

There are big differences between elementary schools in Finland. Yle found out how middle schools apply to vocational schools and upper secondary schools.

The differences between schools are large in many cities. For example, 80 percent of the 9th graders at Joensuu's Pyhäselkä school apply to a vocational school. Only a small part applies to high school.

Some schools have a lot of applications for upper secondary school. For example, high school is very popular in Helsinki and Espoo.

A school calculator has been published on Yle's website, where you can see how different schools apply for postgraduate studies.
