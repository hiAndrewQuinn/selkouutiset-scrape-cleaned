Construction of optical fiber connections. Ahtisaari monument. The Hildur play. Tuesday's weather.

## Construction of optical fiber connections

First, the topic is optical fiber.

Many new fiber optic connections are being built in Finland.

Sometimes optical fiber is built so close to the ground that it can cause problems.

An optical fiber can, for example, break when traffic signs are installed in the same place.

A lot of fiber optic connections are being built in Finland.

However, the law does not specify how deep the optical fiber must be dug. Municipalities can decide the matter themselves.

The recommendation is that the depth of the trench is 70 centimeters.

However, some municipalities accept that the optical fiber will be closer to the ground.

That's why there is a lot of talk now about good construction methods.

## Ahtisaari memorial

Then the topic is the monument.

The monument to President **Martti Ahtisaari** was unveiled yesterday.

The memorial is at the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki, where Ahtisaari's grave is located. Ahtisaari died last year.

The monument is in the shape of an olive tree leaf. The leaf of the olive tree is a symbol of peace, and Ahtisaari was known for peace work.

The designer of the monument is **Harri Pakarinen**.

The monument to President Ahtisaari has been unveiled.

Martti Ahtisaari was the president of Finland from 1994 to 2000. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008.

## Hildur play

Then the subject of theater.

Hildur is a new play at Turku City Theatre.

In the play, the Icelandic policeman Hildur has adventures.

The story is from **Satu Rämö's** books. Finnish Rämö lives in Iceland.

Rämö's Hildur books are really popular.

Now Hildur can be seen at the Turku City Theatre.

Hildur is played by **Asta Sveholm**. For the play, Sveholm had to learn to surf.

The second main character of the play is the Finnish policeman Jakob. Jakob is played by **Sami Lalou**.

Lalou also had to teach something for a difficult play: in the play, Jakob weaves.

The Hildur play has subtitles in English and plain Finnish.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Tuesday, the weather will be cloudy almost all over the country.

The sun can shine in the west. It may rain a little rain and snow in the east.

In Lapland it is freezing, elsewhere the temperature is 0-5 degrees.
