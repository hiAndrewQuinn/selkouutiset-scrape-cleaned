At the beginning of October, a large group of Filipinos arrived at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. They didn't come on vacation, they came to Finland to work.

The group included about 20 Filipino nurses. They have already been hired in Finland in the Philippines, where they also started studying the Finnish language. Everyone has at least a 2-year employment contract in Finland.

At the airport, there were Filipinos who already live in Finland to meet the caregivers. They have shared good experiences from Finland with newcomers.

Filipinos say that the reasons for moving to Finland are the balance between work and free time and the equality of people.

The Philippines is one of the countries from which Finland wants workers.

The Finnish government wants immigrants from 4 countries in particular. The countries are the Philippines, India, Vietnam and Brazil. Finland has chosen countries, for example, on the basis of what kind of training is organized there.

In these countries, Finland has organized campaigns that tell about Finland. In addition, Finland has hired experts in these countries who attract employees to Finland.

The most arrivals have come from the Philippines, which has become employees in the care sector. India has become experts in information technology. From Vietnam, Finland has received workers for agriculture and horticulture. There are still few people from Brazil.

Finland needs workers from abroad. The reason is that Finns are getting older. The number of pensioners is increasing, but the number of people of working age is decreasing.

Today, Finland grants approximately 20,000 work permits to foreigners per year. Companies and experts estimate that in the future Finland will have to issue twice as many work permits, i.e. at least 40,000 work permits per year, in order to have enough workers.
