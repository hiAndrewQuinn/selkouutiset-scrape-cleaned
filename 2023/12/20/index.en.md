Access to non-urgent treatment has become easier. This is what the Institute of Health and Welfare says. In October, more than 80 percent of patients received outpatient care within a week of the need being identified, for example, at a doctor's office or at a remote reception.

Within the last 2 weeks, approximately 90 percent of the patients received treatment. Most of the patients were able to see a nurse or health nurse.

It has been about a week for the nurses for some time now. Now you can also see a doctor often in a week.

### EU asylum policy

The EU countries have reached an agreement on reforming the immigration and asylum laws. The purpose is to speed up entry checks.

The laws are changed so that waiting centers for asylum seekers can be established in border areas. Deportations are accelerated. If a person receives a negative asylum decision, they can be deported quickly.

There will also be burden sharing for EU countries. It means that all member countries jointly contribute to the costs incurred by asylum seekers. Asylum seekers can be distributed to different EU countries.

### Neste's Porvoo refinery

The oil company Neste is making major reforms at the Porvoo refinery. Neste invests, i.e. spends a lot of money, in the refinery in Porvoo. The refinery focuses on using renewable raw materials and recycled raw materials.

The change is really big. That's why it lasts about 10 years. Changes are made in stages. The purpose is for the Porvoo refinery to become a leading refinery for renewable and recycled materials.

The Porvoo refinery produces, for example, renewable diesel and raw materials for the chemical industry. Neste will spend around 2.5 billion euros to renovate the Porvoo refinery.

### Avoiding the news

Many Finns sometimes avoid the news. This is what the Uutismedia online survey says. About half of Finns say that they don't always want to see or hear all the news.

Avoidance of the news has increased somewhat in Finland. This is what journalism professor **Mikko Villi** says.

One reason is the distressing nature of the news. Sad news feels heavy. Another reason is boredom. The same topic can be repeated often in the news. Then a person does not always want to read or hear the news.

### Weather

![The temperature is at zero in the south. It's quite cold in the north.](https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/c_crop,h_1080,w_1919,x_0,y_0/ar_1.7777777777777777,c_fill,g_faces,h_675,w_1200/dpr_1.0/q_auto :eco/f_auto/fl_lossy/v1703094827/39-121885065832a0eb04da)

A little snow and freezing drizzle will fall in the south on Thursday. It is cloudy in a large part of the country, but it is raining, i.e. not raining. The temperature is between 0 and -15 degrees. It is warmest on the south coast. It is coldest in Northern Lapland.
