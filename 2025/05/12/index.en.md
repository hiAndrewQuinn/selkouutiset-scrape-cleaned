Catholic Church. Mothers. Eurovision. Weather.

## Catholic Church in Finland

First, a word about the Catholic Church.

The Catholic Church is growing rapidly in Finland.

New members of the Catholic Church are often immigrants. New members come from countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and African countries.

Masses are so popular that not everyone can always fit inside the church. This is the case, for example, at St. Henry's Cathedral in Helsinki.

The African Mass will be held at the Lutheran Kallio Church because there is no space elsewhere.

There are more and more Catholics in Finland.

18,000 people in Finland belong to the Catholic Church.

## Becoming a mother over 40

Then about mothers.

More and more women are becoming mothers for the first time over the age of 40.

**Emmi Sainio** will soon have her first baby. She is 41 years old. **Janica Ritanoro** also had her first child over the age of 40.

Studies show that a mother may be more relaxed if she is older.

Many women have their first child over the age of 40.

In recent years, women over 40 have given birth to hundreds of babies.
