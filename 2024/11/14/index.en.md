## Salary increases

First, news about labor market policy.

SAK's member unions are demanding 10 percent salary increases.

SAK is the central organization of Finnish trade unions.

SAK demands that salaries be increased by 6 percent in the first year and 4 percent in the following year.

SAK chairman **Jarkko Eloranta** says that a salary increase is needed because many prices have risen and people's purchasing power has decreased.

*"We have a big problem with the purchasing power of wage earners and also with their livelihood. Partly due to the actions of the government and partly due to high inflation."*

SAK's member unions are demanding 10 percent wage increases over 2 years.

The employers' association EK is surprised by SAK's demand.
