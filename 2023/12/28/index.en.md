Employee organizations continue political strikes against the government.

Teollisuusliitto reported new strikes today. The strikes are organized in the Kilpilahti and Kokkola industrial areas of Porvoo. For example, Neste's oil refinery in Porvoo is shut down due to a strike.

The strikes are at the beginning of February and will last for two days. The strikes affect a total of 7,000 workers.

The trade union Pro says that it also organizes strikes at the same time and in the same workplaces as the Confederation of Industry. Strikes are organized in 14 companies.

The unions oppose the government's labor market reforms and social security cuts.

### Digital health services

Digital transactions in health services are becoming more common.

According to a survey by the Institute of Health and Welfare, more than 35 percent of Finns have used digital social and health services during the year.

Digital services are now being developed in all welfare areas. For example, the Hyvä-digi digisotekeskus started in the welfare region of Eastern Uusimaa at the beginning of September. During the first three months, Hyvä-digi has treated a total of approximately 7,000 patients.

In digital health services, the customer communicates with a doctor or nurse via chat or video connection.

### Fishing Act

The fishing law changes at the turn of the year. The new law aims to reduce the suffering of prey fish.

According to the law, game fish or fish used as bait must be killed as quickly and painlessly as possible. Also, iced fish must not be left on the ice to die, they must be euthanized.

### Greeting

Finns greet a familiar person differently than a stranger.

Last fall, Yle asked what word Finns use to greet a friend, and what word they use to greet a store cashier. There were more than 130,000 responses.

The answers revealed that the majority of Finns greet a friend with the word \"hi\". The shop cashier, on the other hand, is most often greeted with the word \"hey\".

There are also regional differences. For example, in Eastern Finland, Kainuu, the Oulu region and Eastern Lapland, the most common greeting to a friend is \"hello\".
