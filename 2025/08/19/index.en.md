## You can study boating in high school

Next, news about special lines in high schools.

In many Finnish upper secondary schools, you can study special school subjects.

Special courses include flying and circus arts, for example. There is an upper secondary school in Padasjoki where you can study boating.

Special school subjects interest young people.

Many small high schools have a shortage of students, and therefore offer special school subjects.

There are approximately 3,500 upper secondary school students in Finland who study in special programmes.

## Elderly people are monitored with devices

Finally, news about caring for the elderly at home.

Devices will be installed in senior homes to monitor the elderly. The devices will monitor the movements of the elderly when they are alone at home.

Small devices are placed on doors and beds, for example. The device tells you when an elderly person uses a door or goes to bed to sleep.

Then caregivers of the elderly know what the elderly person is doing alone at home.

An elderly person receives additional help if they cannot use a device.

The assistance provided to an elderly person can also be reduced if they know how to use the equipment themselves.

Devices will be installed in senior homes to monitor the movements of the elderly.

## The weather varies

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Wednesday.

There may be a little rain in almost the entire country.

Sometimes it's dry, meaning it doesn't rain.

The temperature is 6-17 degrees.
