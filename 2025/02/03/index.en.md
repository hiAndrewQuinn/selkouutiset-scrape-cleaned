Strike. USA. Influenza. Weather.

## Strike

First, the topic of the strike.

A major strike may begin in Finnish grocery stores next week.

The workers are going to go on strike if the employers don't pay more.

Employees and employers will negotiate wages this week.

A big strike in grocery stores may start next week.

Grocery stores still won't be completely closed if a strike starts. Bosses can do the work so that the stores are open.

Shops may still be open less than usual. However, food will not run out.

If the strike starts, it will start next Monday and end on Thursday.

## USA

Then the topic is the USA.

US President **Donald Trump** has imposed heavy tariffs on three countries. The countries are Canada, Mexico and China.

Canadian and Mexican companies must pay a 25 percent tariff when they sell goods to the US.

For example, when they sell goods to the USA that cost $100, the customs fee is $25.

Canada, Mexico and China are planning to retaliate against the US. They are imposing tariffs on US companies.

President Donald Trump also plans to impose tariffs on European and Finnish companies.

That could be bad for the Finnish economy.

When countries impose high tariffs, they do less trade.

Scientists say that's bad for the world economy.

## Influenza

Then the topic of influenza.

There is a lot of influenza in Finland right now. Influenza infections have increased recently.

People call health centers a lot because they suspect they have the flu.

There is now influenza throughout Finland.

It is a good idea for older and sick people to get the flu vaccine.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

It won't rain much during the day on Tuesday.

Snow will come to Finland from the west in the evening. The whole country will be freezing on Tuesday.
