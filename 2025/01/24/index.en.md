OSCE. Finnish minerals. Collections. Weather.

## Finland is the chairman of the OSCE

Finland's chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has begun. The term will last this year.

Finland's task is not easy. The main reason for this is Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine.

Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen still believes that the OSCE has potential. Furthermore, if peace comes to Ukraine, the OSCE may have a role in monitoring it.

Finland's chairmanship of the OSCE has begun.

The OSCE also has its roots in Finland. In 1975, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe was held in Helsinki. It was opened by the President of the Republic, Urho Kekkonen.

## Finland has many important minerals

Now news about minerals in Finland.

US interest in Finnish minerals may increase after Donald Trump was re-elected as president.

Finnish soil contains many critical minerals. The US needs them for its defense industry.

Therefore, competition for the mineral resources of the northern regions is intensifying.

US interest in Finnish minerals may grow.

Eastern and Northern Finland in particular have a lot of raw materials that Trump wants.

The defense industry and the green transition need, for example, cobalt, nickel, phosphates, platinum and palladium. Finland is the EU's largest cobalt producer.

Finland is also starting lithium production.

## The popularity of the group has grown

Then about the church and the collection money.

Last year, Finns gave more money to the collection than ever before. The collection is an old Christian custom that is growing in popularity.

The donations are collected at the church and given to charity.

Finnish Evangelical Lutheran congregations collected just under 9 million euros in collection proceeds last year.

The amount is the highest in the 2020s.

Usually, cash is put into the collection. In many churches, you can also pay for the collection with your mobile phone.
