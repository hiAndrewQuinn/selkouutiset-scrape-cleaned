The topic of the week is heat at work. Breaks are important. There is now a new recommendation for breaks.

Yesterday, Friday, Finland set a weather record. The temperature has been above 30 degrees for 14 days in a row. Now it's been 15 days.

## Recommendations from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health for hot work

The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has issued recommendations for heavy work in hot weather. The new recommendations are based on research.

The breaks must be longer than previously thought.

The physical strain of work has a great influence on how the human body heats up.

It is now recommended that work in temperatures above 30 degrees should only last 30–45 minutes, after which you must take a break of about 20 minutes.

The previous recommendation was 10–15 minutes per hour.

## The study was conducted in a laboratory

Heavy work in temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius raises a person's core temperature above 38 degrees Celsius. This happens within half an hour.

At the same time, muscle strength and work efficiency decrease. Heat puts a strain on breathing and blood circulation.

The heart rate and brain temperature increase, and the person becomes tired.

Resting at room temperature returns the body temperature to baseline within 45–60 minutes.

## The employer keeps the breaks long

Employers approach hot weather breaks differently.

For example, the Finnish Machinery Entrepreneurs Association says that the new breaks seem long. However, industry manager Ville Järvinen says that people's health must be taken into account.

The responsibility for taking breaks lies with the companies.

Järvinen hopes that both the employer and employees will be flexible as needed.

## It's hot in many workplaces right now

The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health estimates that approximately 60,000 Finns work in hot conditions.

For example, the temperature at the Hatanpää tram construction site in Tampere can now reach 40 degrees.

The temperature at the roofing construction site in Tohlop, Tampere, can be over 60 degrees. Due to the heat, work starts as early as 5 in the morning.

At the Tornio renovation site, you can take breaks if you feel like it. In hot weather, the employer offers mineral water because it contains salts that are important for the body.

## Repetition

The topic of the week in the news was hard work and heat.

The new recommendations from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health have come into effect.

The breaks must now be longer than previously known.
