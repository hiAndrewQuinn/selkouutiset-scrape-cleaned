The Helsinki District Court has imprisoned the Russian Voislav Torden. Torden is suspected of war crimes in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.

The Supreme Court decided earlier that Finland will not extradite Torden to Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities have wanted Finland to hand Torden over for a preliminary investigation. However, the Supreme Court said that the conditions in Ukrainian prisons are too bad.

Torden founded a military group suspected of atrocities in Ukraine. Torden says he has not committed war crimes.

### Suspicion of a crime on the table

The police suspect crimes in the Pöytä municipality home care.

In September 2022, the police found the body of an 87-year-old woman in her home. The woman's 76-year-old husband was lying on the floor in poor condition.

The couple was not a client of the home care, but the home care visited them. Päytä's home care didn't immediately do anything, even though it knew about the couple's difficult situation.

The police do not suspect the nurses who visited the couple of a crime.

### YIT's dismissals

The construction company YIT is reducing approximately 50 jobs in Finland. In addition, people are furloughed for a limited period of time.

The company previously estimated that about 90 jobs need to be cut. YIT employs about 5,000 people in 9 countries.

### Death doulas

Death doulas are trained in Finland.

A dying doula is a person who supports a dying person and their family. A bereavement doula can also assist with, for example, a care will, a will or other documents.

The death doula profession is new in Finland. The training started in Helsinki only last May. The first 13 death doulas graduated in November.

In February of next year, death doula training will also start in Oulu and next fall in Tampere.
