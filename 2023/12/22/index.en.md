Yle's first major election debate of the presidential election was on Thursday.

All candidates participated in the discussion. There are 9 candidates.

The discussion focused especially on foreign policy and security policy, because they are the most important duties of the President of Finland.

Most of the candidates said the military needs more money. The reason is that Russia is Finland's neighbor and Russia has attacked Ukraine.

The presidential election will be held at the end of January.

Friday has been the shortest day of the year. They say it's the winter solstice.

In southern Finland, the sun is in the sky for only a few hours. For example, a day in Helsinki is a little less than 6 hours long.

In the far north, the sun doesn't rise at all this time of year. In Finland's northernmost municipality, Utsjoki, the sun will rise next time in mid-January.

After the winter solstice, the day slowly begins to lengthen again. The longest day of the year is in 6 months.

### Snowing
