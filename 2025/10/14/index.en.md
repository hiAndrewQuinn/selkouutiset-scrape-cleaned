Gaza. Ukrainian refugees. Vocational schools. Weather.

## Gaza ceasefire

Initially, the topic is Gaza.

The future of Gaza has been discussed at a summit in Egypt.

Four countries signed a document on the Gaza ceasefire agreement this evening. The agreement was signed by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, who are the guarantors of the agreement.

Britain has also promised to participate in monitoring the ceasefire in Gaza.

The Egyptian summit also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

## Ukrainian refugees

Then we will talk about Ukrainian refugees in Finland.

The majority of Ukrainian refugees in Finland do not intend to return to Ukraine.

The Ministry of the Interior has now surveyed the moods of Ukrainian refugees for the third time.

66 percent of respondents said they did not plan to return to their home country, a number that has clearly increased from previous surveys.

Only 6 percent plan to return to Ukraine once the Russian invasion is over.

Most Ukrainian refugees want to stay here. Adaptation to Finland has been made easier, for example, by improving their language skills.

## Vocational school contact teaching

Then the topic is vocational schools.

Contact teaching in vocational schools has decreased significantly.

In a survey by Yle MOT, a third of vocational education institutions say that contact teaching has been reduced this decade. Its amount has decreased by approximately 300 hours per degree.

Contact teaching refers to traditional teaching that takes place in classrooms and workshops.

Contact teaching in vocational schools has been cut back due to reforms and austerity measures.

It is also reflected in working life. 80 percent of companies said that student skills have deteriorated this decade.

## Wednesday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Wednesday, it will be cloudy almost throughout the country. There may be some sunshine on the west coast and in the north.

It is warm in the south and west, cooler in the east and north.
