Factories. Russian elections. Romanies. Weather.

## Factories

First, news about the situation at the factories.

In Finland, more factories are stopped due to strikes. The factories can't work because the goods transport is stopped.

Metsägroup Metsägroup plans to stop the factories in Kemi at the weekend. About 400 employees work at the factories.

The employees do maintenance work when the factories in Kemi are stopped. Therefore, the salary payment can continue.

The lumber company Versowood also has problems because its products do not leave the ports for customers.

It is possible that Versowood will have to put employees on forced leave. During the compulsory leave, employees do not get paid. Versowood has 900 employees.

In Finland, more factories are stopped due to strikes.

The factories' own employees are not on strike, but political strikes in various sectors hinder the factories' operations.

Political strikes are a protest by trade unions to a government that intends to change the rules of working life.

## Russian elections

Then news from abroad.

There are presidential elections in Russia. Voting continues until Sunday.

Elections are not fair. It is already known that President Vladimir Putin will win these elections as well.

Putin has taken care that there are no real opponents of Putin among the candidates.

## Romanies

Then we meet the Roma.

Many Roma are now moving from Sweden back to Finland.

Many Finnish Roma moved to Sweden earlier, where it was easier to find work, for example.

Now many are coming back. They say the reason for the return migration is gang violence in Sweden.

For example, around 20 Roma families from Sweden have already moved to Hyvinkää. Many are involved in the activities of Hyvinkää's Pentecostal congregation.

Many Roma therefore move from Sweden back to Finland.

Roma are an old minority in Finland. Roma have lived here for 500 years.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

In the southern and central parts of the country, it rains snow and water.

It's dusty in the north, sunny in Lapland.

The temperature is between -5 and +5 degrees.
