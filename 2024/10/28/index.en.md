Fees for drivers and food couriers. Helsinki Art Museum's exhibition about Tove Jansson. Tuesday's weather.

## Fees for drivers and food couriers

First, the topic of drivers and food delivery.

Drivers and food couriers want bigger rewards.

**Papy Nkunda** is worried about the situation of food parcels. He says that Wolt's food delivery fees have decreased.

Nkunda is the chairman of the couriers' professional section and has negotiated the fees with Wolt.

Last week, more than 70 drivers demonstrated in Helsinki. They were drivers of the taxi service Bolt.

Drivers say that Bolt charges them too much commission. The brokerage fee is so big that the driver has too little money left over from the job.

Drivers and food couriers want bigger rewards.

Wolt and Bolt think that the rewards are big enough.

Researcher **Laura Sepp√§nen** says that the work of a driver and food courier can be a good side job. But the bad aspects of work are accentuated if there is no other work.

Many immigrants work through Wolt or Bolt because they have no other options.

## Tove Jansson exhibition

Then art.

The Helsinki Art Museum presents the art of **Tove Jansson**.

Jansson is known for his Moomins, but this exhibition presents pictures that Jansson made for public spaces.

Jansson did wall paintings, for example, in the Helsinki City Hall. 

Visitors to the exhibition can learn how Jansson designed large wall paintings.

The Helsinki Art Museum exhibition continues until April.

## Suzanne Innes-Stubb

The president's spouse **Suzanne Innes-Stubb** was a guest of Selkouutinen last week.

In the radio program [Uutisviikko selkosuomeksi](https://yle.fi/a/74-20120411) Innes-Stubb told how life changed when Alexander Stubb became the president of Finland.

On Selkouutinen's [TV broadcast](https://yle.fi/a/74-20119416) Innes-Stubb told what she thinks about the Finnish language and studying it.
