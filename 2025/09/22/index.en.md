## Methane emissions from cows

Finally, some news about agriculture.

A Finnish methane extractor can reduce agricultural emissions.

Cows produce a lot of methane.

Researcher **Henri Siljanen** says that microbes break down methane.

The invention is Finnish. It originated at the University of Eastern Finland.

The methane problem is big because there are a lot of cows on Earth.

It is estimated that there are approximately 260 million cows on Earth.
