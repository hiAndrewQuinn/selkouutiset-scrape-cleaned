There have been many cable failures in the Baltic Sea in a short period of time.

Most recently, on Christmas Day, an Estlink 2 electricity cable and 4 internet cables were cut there.

Police suspect that the cables were broken by a ship called the Eagle S.

It dragged the anchor on the seabed so much that the cables broke.

The Estlink 2 cable carries electricity between Finland and Estonia.

Internet cables carry internet traffic.

Finnish authorities quickly stopped the Eagle S ship.

Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** says that the Eagle S is a Russian ship.

The police suspect that the Eagle S ship has damaged important Finnish cables in the Baltic Sea.

The police are investigating the matter. That is why the Eagle S ship is not allowed to leave Finland.

The ship is in really bad shape.

Its condition is so bad that it is dangerous because it has a lot of oil on board.

## Effects of cable damage

The Estlink 2 electricity cable and 4 internet cables broke in the Baltic Sea at Christmas.

It will take many months to repair the electrical cable.

Therefore, electricity can sometimes be a little more expensive than usual.

Data cables, on the other hand, do not affect the life of the average person.

## NATO is guarding
