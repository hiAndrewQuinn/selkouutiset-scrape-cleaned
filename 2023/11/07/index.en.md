Corona vaccinations have started too late this fall. This is also what the Institute of Health and Welfare, or THL, says, which coordinates the organization of corona vaccinations.

Corona starts to spread in the fall, because people are indoors with others again. This fall, the number of corona cases and corona patients has increased rapidly.

THL says that corona vaccinations must be organized at the same time as flu vaccinations. Otherwise, there are not enough workers to handle all the vaccinations.

That is why corona vaccinations have been given a little too late and flu vaccinations a little too early. However, the most important thing is that risk groups receive both vaccinations.

It is especially important for people over 80 to receive a booster vaccination against the corona virus, THL reminds.

### Strikes

Strikes have stopped work at many workplaces in Finland.

On Tuesday there were strikes in northern Finland, on Wednesday there were strikes in the Turku region. Strikes last a maximum of 1 day.

Strikes stop factories for a day, for example. In addition, strikes close sports facilities and swimming pools, for example. On Wednesday, the strike will stop Turku's buses.

The workers' unions plan to organize day-long strikes throughout the next month.

Workers' unions organize strikes because they are angry with the government.

For example, the government intends to change the rules of sick leave so that the employee will no longer receive salary from the first day of sick leave.

In addition, the government plans to make it easier to fire an employee.

### Seniors who are able to work

There are many pensioners in Finland who are still able to work. The information is from a study by the Institute of Health and Welfare.

More than 50 percent of people aged 65-74 estimate that they are able to work. However, only about 10 percent of them go to work.

Retired people can have a very different condition. Others can run, but walking can be difficult for some.

### Weather
