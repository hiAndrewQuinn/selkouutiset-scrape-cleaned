Residence permit and unemployment. People with dementia. The play My Brother the Lionheart. Weather.

## Residence permit and unemployment

First, the topic of residence permit.

A foreigner may soon lose his residence permit quickly due to unemployment. Minister of Labor **Arto Satonen** told about it yesterday.

The government's plan is that a foreign worker has 3 months to look for a new job if he becomes unemployed. If he can't find a new job, he has to leave Finland.

A foreigner can quickly lose his residence permit due to unemployment.

If an unemployed foreigner is in an expert position, he has 6 months to find a new job.

That too is too little, says this unemployed Indian robotics engineer. Even job interviews take a long time, he says.

## People with dementia

Then the topic is people with memory problems.

People with dementia are often excluded from social life. This is what a new study says.

Scientists talk about social death. It means people don't talk to someone with dementia. They think that the amnesiac doesn't understand anything anymore.

In a nursing home, loved ones can even be asked not to visit the amnesiac too often.

People with dementia are often excluded from social life.

Researcher **Jari Pirhonen** says that the social death of people with dementia can be prevented.

For example, loved ones with dementia can participate in the life of a nursing home. The most important thing is that a person is good until the end of life.

## New play

Then news from the theater.

Helsinki City Theater has a new play.

It's called Brother Leijonamieli. The story of the play is from the book by the Swedish **Astrid Lindgren**.

The story tells about a sick little boy Korpus and Korpus' brother Joonatan. The theme is death.

The story has sadness and light at the same time. That's why the story feels real, says actor **Alexander Wendelin**. He is Korppu in the play.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow the sun will shine in the south.

It's cloudy and foggy in the north and it can also rain a little in places.

The temperature is 10-15 degrees in the southern and central part of the country, 5-10 degrees in the north.
