## Opening of the Parliament and the SDP

First, domestic politics.

The opening ceremony of the Riksdag was held today. The Riksdag is the annual working session of the Parliament.

The spring session of Parliament began yesterday.

**Jussi Halla-aho** of the Finns Party was elected as the Speaker. The deputy speakers are **Paula Risikko** of the National Coalition Party and **Tarja Filatov** of the Social Democratic Party.

**Tytti Tuppurainen** will continue to lead the parliamentary group of the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party.

Tuppurainen has been in the spotlight a lot. The Finnish News Agency STT has written that Tuppurainen has behaved badly towards aides and MPs.

The opening of the Finnish Parliament was today.

## Municipal finances

Then from the municipalities' money.

More than 40 percent of Finnish municipalities made a loss last year.

The Association of Local and Regional Authorities' comparison shows that Vantaa was the worst-affected city. Vantaa's loss was almost 82 million euros.

Vantaa is the fourth largest city in Finland.

The economy of Vantaa is facing difficulties because the construction sector is in a bad situation and there are many unemployed people.

More than 40 percent of Finnish municipalities made a loss.

However, the capital Helsinki made a profit of around 150 million euros last year. The second largest city, Espoo, made a profit of 110 million.

## Al-Hol camp and the Finns

Finally, about the al-Hol camp and the Finns.

In Syria, the al-Hol camp may be closed.

The camp is home to several thousand family members of ISIS fighters. There are still about 10 Finns among them. Most of them are children.

The Syrian central government began to control al-Hol after the January fighting.

Aid organizations tell Yle that it is now difficult to get food, water and supplies.

Syria may close al-Hol camp.

Consul General **Jussi Tanner** from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs says that Finnish children must be able to enter Finnish society and school.

Over the years, 36 people have returned from the camp to Finland.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Thursday, the weather will be cloudy throughout the country.

Cloudiness varies. Sun may be visible.

In Northern Lapland the temperature is around -5 degrees, elsewhere around -15 degrees.
