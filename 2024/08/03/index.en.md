World Overconsumption Day

Here is Uutisviikko in plain Finnish and Pertti Seppä. The topic of the news week this time is the consumption of natural resources. Thursday of this week was World Overconsumption Day. During the first 7 months of the year, people consumed everything that nature produces in one year. Finland's overspending day was already in April. Now we will talk about the overconsumption of natural resources and how we can reduce it.

## World Overconsumption Day

World Overconsumption Day was this year on Thursday, August 1. This is what the organization Global Footprint Network says. The organization monitors how much the world's countries use natural resources.

So this year, by the beginning of August, people have used as much natural resources as the earth's nature can produce in a year. It can be said that one earth is not enough for humans.

Natural resources are important to people. We need them when we produce food, energy and goods. That is why it is dangerous to consume nature too quickly.

## Finnish overspending day

Finland's overspending day was already April 12. So it can be calculated that Finns consume 4 times more natural resources than nature can handle. We consume nature more than many others.

Finns consume natural resources for food production, energy production and transport, for example.

## Reducing overspending

Each of us can make a difference in not using natural resources too much and too quickly.

Finnish Environment Institute specialist Hannu Savolainen says there are many ways to reduce overconsumption: We can eat less meat and more vegetables. We can drive less and cycle and walk more. We can also repair goods and buy new goods for less.

It's good to look for meaning in life in places other than things, says Savolainen.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was World Overconsumption Day. Let's repeat the most important things.

This year, World Overconsumption Day was on August 1. So the people of the world consumed as much natural resources in 7 months as the earth can produce in a year.

Finland's overspending day was already in the spring. Finns consume more natural resources than many others.

We can all save natural resources by, for example, eating less meat and buying less goods. Goods are not the most important content of life.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
