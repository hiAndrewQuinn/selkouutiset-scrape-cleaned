Social assistance. Bottled water. Robots. Weather.

## Social assistance needs to be changed

First, the matter of social assistance.

The government wants to change social assistance.

Kela provides income support to people whose income is not enough to cover everyday expenses, such as food and housing.

Last year, Kela provided social assistance to 360,000 people.

The government proposes to change social assistance. If the change is made, many social assistance recipients will be forced to apply for full-time work or primary support. Primary supports include housing benefit and unemployment benefits.

If a person does not apply for work or primary support, they may lose part of their social assistance.

Experts oppose changing social assistance. Experts say that the change would force many people who are not really able to work to find work.

Municipalities oppose changing social assistance because it would cause congestion in employment services.

## Bottled water is sold more

The next topic is bottled water.

Bottled water is being sold more in Finland than before.

Bottled water companies say that bottled water is now sold twice as much as it was ten years ago.

During the same period, much less beer and cider has been sold.

One reason for the increase in bottled water sales is improved multi-bottle packaging.

Many people also like to buy flavored bottled water.

Approximately 150 million liters of bottled water are sold in Finland annually.

## Robots are evolving rapidly

Now the news about robots.

Robots are developing rapidly.

Humanoid robots resembling humans are on display at this World Robot Conference in Beijing, China.

For example, this robot made by a Chinese company can recharge itself.

Humanoid robots are still expensive. Their movement and artificial intelligence also need to be developed.

Robots are being developed especially in China and the United States.

Companies say that in the future, humanoid robots could help people in the workplace and at home.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Thursday, the weather will be summery. Temperatures will rise above 20 degrees and it may be hot. There will be light rain in almost the entire country. There may be a little rain in Lapland.
