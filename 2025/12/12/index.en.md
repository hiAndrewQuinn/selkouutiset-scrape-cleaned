NATO. Greenwashing Directive. Educational agents and foreign students. Weather.

## NATO from Russia

First, about defense.

Defense alliance NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warns that NATO countries could be Russia's next target.

Rutte urges NATO countries to quickly increase defense spending. Finland is also a member of NATO.

Rutte said in Berlin that too many NATO member countries do not understand the seriousness of the Russian threat.

Russia invaded Ukraine almost 4 years ago and is still at war. NATO Secretary General warns that NATO countries could be next.

## Greenwashing Directive

Now about the EU directive regarding greenwashing.

Food packaging often contains vague environmental claims, such as "climate-positive choice" or "carbon-free production".

Many labels will have to be removed next year. A European Union directive, or regulation, prohibits environmental claims that are not true.

Senior researcher Juha-Matti Katajajuuri gives an example:

\- *Here you can find such a herring product, which says I’m green. Such overly general I’m green, environmentally friendly, climate positive, they give the wrong image to consumers, are too general, they will be banned in the future.*

We want accurate information on food packaging.

After next autumn, environmental impacts must be clearly communicated and claims must be proven.

## Education agents

Then about foreign students.

Finland has been marketed misleadingly to foreign students.

Yle's MOT program reveals that foreign consulting companies, or education agents, are providing false information about Finland.

For example, agents say that foreign students can easily find jobs in Finland that can pay for their studies.

*- I read in the newspapers that Finland is the happiest country and the passport ranks third.*

Finland has been marketed to foreign students in a misleading way. There are no jobs, money runs out, and food has to be obtained from bread lines.

Finland has wanted foreign students. Many have come, especially from South Asia.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weekend is widely spent in freezing weather.

Saturday is rain-free.

It will be quite sunny in the east. Clouds will spread to the west and snowfall will also occur in the evening.
