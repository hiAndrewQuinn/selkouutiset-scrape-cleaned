Greenland. Student aid. Ecological theater. Weather.

## Finland, Greenland and USA

First, international politics.

President of the Republic Alexander Stubb says that Finland supports Denmark in resolving the Greenland crisis. US President Donald Trump demands Greenland from Denmark.

The world's largest island, Greenland, is a self-governing territory belonging to Denmark. Greenland is located between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean.

Stubb met with the Association of Political Journalists at the Presidential Palace.

The Danish Prime Minister has been touring Europe seeking support. Stubb did not directly say what Finland would do if the problem between Denmark and the US is not resolved.

## Student financial aid reform

Then news about studying.

Student financial aid is being reformed. The working group proposes four major changes to student financial aid. The aim is to ensure students' livelihood and rapid graduation.

The report was handed over to Minister of Youth Sandra Bergqvist.

The working group says that the most important thing is to restore the index increases in student grants. Then the student grant will increase every year by the same amount as the cost of living increases.

Student financial aid is being reformed. However, the return of index increases may take at least a couple of years.

## Ecological theater

Finally, about theater and ecology.

A new musical implements recycling.

The musical New Eden opens at the Helsinki City Theatre next week. It tells the story of the world after nuclear war.

The theatre wants to move towards a more ecologically sustainable direction in its production. Recycling is important. This is particularly evident in the materials used to make costumes and sets.

The actors' coats are dyed. The costumes are made from scraps of fabric, or cutting waste.

Initially, the goal is to have half of the materials used in the costumes and sets recycled. They also plan to be reused many times.

A new musical implements recycling.

The set designer has searched for material in the theater's warehouse. For example, the sofa has already been on stage many times.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be changeable on Saturday.

The sun is shining in the west. It may snow in the east and north.

In the west, the sun is warming and the temperature is above zero, while elsewhere it is freezing.
