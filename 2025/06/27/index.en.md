Sauna deaths. Swimming waters. Summer parties. Weather.

## Sauna deaths

Initially, the topic is sauna deaths.

A large-scale study of sauna deaths has been launched in Finland. The study is being conducted by the National Institute for Health and Welfare.

When someone dies in a sauna, the cause is usually coronary artery disease, or heat stroke. Perhaps about 100 sauna users die from these causes each year.

However, other types of deaths also occur in saunas. For example, sauna users can fall off benches, slip, or suffer carbon monoxide poisoning.

Deaths related to saunas and sauna bathing are being investigated in Finland.

The purpose of the study is to improve the safety of sauna bathing and to develop a recommendation on when a person should not use a sauna.

## Swimming waters

The next topic is the water quality of swimming beaches.

Swimming waters in Finland are clean. The quality of swimming water at public beaches is mainly excellent or good.

The water quality was poor at only three beaches, according to the European Environment Agency's bathing water report.

Inland, bathing waters were often cleaner than on the coast.

Finnish bathing waters are clean.

The quality of bathing water is determined by monitoring the number of bacteria. The presence of blue-green algae is not taken into account.

## Summer parties

Finally, the topic is Summer Evenings.

The Lestadion summer event Suvisuerat starts today at Loppe.

The Summer Festival is the largest religious summer event in the Nordic countries, attracting perhaps up to 80,000 people.

Summer parties are held in Lopp채 at the R채ysk채l채 airport. For example, a shop, restaurant, health center and fire station have been opened in the area.

Summer parties last until Monday.

The event may cause traffic jams on the roads of Southern Finland.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Saturday.

There may be light rain throughout the country. There will also be light drizzle during the day.

The temperature is 15-20 degrees.
