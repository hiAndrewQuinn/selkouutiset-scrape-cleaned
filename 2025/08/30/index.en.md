HAV Dolphin. Air Force. Sibelius Festival. Weather forecast.

## HAV Dolphin

First, news about security policy.

The HAV Dolphin cargo ship arrived in Finland yesterday. The ship arrived at the port of Vaasa.

The ship has been followed in the media because it may have been involved in espionage. However, there is no evidence of espionage.

The ship brought steel beams from Belgium to Vaasa.

Finnish Customs and the Coast Guard visited the ship. The inspections found nothing unusual.

The HAV Dolphin cargo ship arrived in Vaasa yesterday.

The ship sails under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda.

Authorities are monitoring the ship's movements.

## Air Force flag

Now news from the Army Air Force.

The flags are used at Air Force events and celebrations.

The Air Force flags are being renewed.

The swastika, the old emblem of the Air Force, will be removed from the flags.

The swastika is an old symbol of good luck. It was first used by the Air Force in 1918.

Later, Nazi Germany also began to use the swastika. That is why some air force partner countries are puzzled by the Finnish swastika.

The swastika will be removed from the Air Force flag due to increased external pressure. The flag reform has begun.

This is what the commander of the Karelian Air Force, **Tomi Böhm**, says.

*"The pressure from outside is intense.
The reform of the flag of the Air Force's divisions is underway.
After some time, we will definitely see a new flag.”*
