The fighting in the Middle East is intensifying. Israel has increased many attacks on Gaza. Israel has struck 150 targets of the extremist organization Hamas.

There is no accurate information about the destruction and casualties in Gaza, because the connections to Gaza are broken.

Many aid organizations have also lost contact with aid workers in Gaza.

The UN General Assembly demands a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The UN General Assembly has issued a resolution on the matter. The resolution condemns violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians.

120 countries voted in favor of the resolution. 14 states voted against. 45 states abstained, i.e. did not take a position on the issue.

For example, Finland and many other countries voted no because the UN resolution did not condemn Hamas's attack on Israel.
