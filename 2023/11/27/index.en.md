Companies are attracting employees from remote work back to offices. Companies hope that new or repaired facilities will attract employees back.

In many workplaces, there are plans to strengthen the company culture, increase learning and promote well-being. All this is difficult to do remotely or in poor facilities.

The good location of the workplace is also more important than ever. For example, in Helsinki, companies are interested in the city center.

In the center of Helsinki, an old office building is even being demolished and a new one is being built in its place. Many companies are ready to pay for a good location.

Air purifiers in kindergartens can significantly reduce children's illness.

A 2-year study finds out how effective air cleaning in a kindergarten affects illnesses. The study also investigates staff illnesses. At the same time, a clear effect on the children's parents' absences from work.

After the first year of research, the results are good. Research doctor Enni Sanmark says that illnesses have decreased by about 30 percent.

1 employee's day of absence costs the employer approximately 370 euros. This does not include healthcare costs or the price of medicines.

Air purifiers have been liked in research kindergartens. Their sound is reasonable. In addition, it has been noticed that the appropriate noise has calmed the children to rest and sleep during naps.
