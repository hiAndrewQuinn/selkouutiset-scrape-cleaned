Eastern border. Id party. Tourism to the cold. Weather.

## Eastern border

First, the topic is the eastern border, i.e. the border between Finland and Russia.

The government is still preparing a law on the security of the eastern border.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo discussed the law with party leaders yesterday, because there are problems with the law.

The government wants the border guards to be able to stop and deport asylum seekers who come from Russia.

However, international agreements say that a person always has the right to seek asylum.

The government is still preparing a law on the security of the eastern border.

The law is needed because Russia started directing asylum seekers to the Finnish border last fall. This is how Russia wanted to cause problems for Finland.

## Id party

Then the news about the end of the Muslim fasting month.

The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan ended yesterday. At the same time, the Eid al-Fitr celebration began.

The Id celebration is also celebrated in different parts of Finland. These pictures are from Helsinki's It√§keskus.

**Ahmed Hassan**, chairman of the Somali Association of Finland, says that the Eid day begins with a joint prayer of all Muslims. After that, there is a festive meal that is enjoyed together with family and friends.

**Isse Saleh**

*- Well, it's important to me that I've fasted for 30 days and today is Id day and I have to eat well and I'm going out to eat with my friends.*

**Pink Kadiri**

*- With family or friends, we all go out to eat together.*

**Saba Kadiri**

*- We will celebrate all this together. We like it.*

## Tourism for the cold

Then the topic is travel.

Cold travel destinations are of interest to tourists today.

Adventurer **Patrick Degerman** asks to think, for example, of a Brazilian boy who has never seen ice or walked in snow. Then Finland can be an interesting travel destination.

Due to climate change, it is very hot in many countries these days.

That's why cold travel destinations are of interest to tourists.

And there is also something else interesting in Finland: silence.

We Finns are good at keeping quiet, says Patrick Degerman.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is cloudy and in some places the sun is shining.

The temperature rises to close to +15 degrees in the south, the temperature is only slightly above zero in the north.
