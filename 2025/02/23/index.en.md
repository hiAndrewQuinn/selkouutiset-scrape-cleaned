Citizenship test

This time, the topic of the news week is the citizenship test.

There may be a citizenship test in Finland.

The citizenship test means that an immigrant must take a test if he or she wants Finnish citizenship.

In the test, the immigrant must know the most important things about Finland.

Many European countries have a citizenship test.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## The government is planning

The government wants Finland to introduce a citizenship test.

There are questions on the citizenship test.

The questions concern, for example, the most important laws in Finland.

The questions also concern Finnish history and Finnish values.

An immigrant must know the answers well enough.

He/she must also know the Finnish language well enough.

## Finnish culture

In the future, there may be a citizenship test in Finland.

The citizenship test is not yet a sure thing, but rather a government plan.

Last Wednesday, the government announced what the citizenship test might be like.

The citizenship test is a test.

In the test, the immigrant must know things about Finnish culture.

You need to know important human rights - for example, that men and women have the same rights.

It may also be that the test asks about Finnish society.

For example, you need to know Finnish democracy and working life.

## Many countries have a citizenship test

If there is a citizenship test in Finland, who has to take it?

A test may be required if the immigrant is between the ages of 16 and 64.

The test may not need to be taken if the immigrant has been in school long enough.

Citizenship tests are not uncommon in Europe.

Many European countries have a citizenship test if a person wants to become a citizen of the country.

At least 14 member countries of the European Union, or EU, have a citizenship test.

The exam is held in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark, for example.

## Repetition

This time, the topic of Uutisviikko was the citizenship test.

Let's repeat the most important things.

There may be a citizenship test in Finland.

The test asks how well the immigrant knows Finland.

That's all for today. See you again, bye!
