## Election budgets

First, news about the presidential election - and money.

The election budgets of the presidential candidates continue to grow.

Alexander Stubb's campaign has already raised more than 2 million euros. Pekka Haavisto's election fund now has around 1.6 million euros.

Private people have donated money to both candidates.

A lot of money is spent on the election campaign of the presidential candidates. Money is spent especially on election advertising.

## Early voting

Early voting for the presidential election ends today.

About 40 percent of those entitled to vote have voted in advance.

The actual election day is next Sunday.

Uutisviikko in plain Finnish tells more about the presidential candidates. The programs can be found at yle.fi/selkouutiset, under![All broadcasts.](https://yle.fi/selkouutiset/kaikki-lahetykset){.aw-iao6s4 .drtaeR .yle__article__link role="link"}

## Akava's march out

Then the strike news.

Political strikes continue.

Members of the Akava trade union in the Helsinki region, Tampere and Turku marched out of their workplaces in the afternoon. The strike lasted two hours.

Akava's members include, for example, engineers, doctors and nurses.

Akawa organized the strike because it opposes the government's labor market reforms.

## The great bombings of Helsinki

Finally, some history.

80 years have passed since the major bombings in Helsinki.

Helsinki was bombed when Finland fought a continuation war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union sent about 2,000 bombers to bomb Helsinki.

The bombs hit the university's main building, for example. About 150 people died in the bombings. However, the damage was surprisingly small.

Historian Ville Jalovaara says that only 4-5 percent of the bombs hit the target. Most of the bombs fell into the sea or outside of Helsinki.

## Wednesday's weather

The weather is cloudy and clear in many places.

The frost is intensifying throughout the country. The end of the week is clearly colder than usual.
