## Shopping places

The Christmas tree market is at its busiest right now.

Many Finns buy spruce from the supermarket or directly from the grower.

Finns are buying more spruce from large stores than before.

Online sales of fir trees are also growing. You can order a fir tree to your home from the online store, and some of the fir trees are already sold in advance.

## Forest spruce

Kuopio-based spruce farmer **Harri Koponen** grows approximately 5,000 Christmas trees every year.

He says that the Christmas tree trade often starts around Independence Day.

The most popular Christmas tree is a spruce just over 2 meters tall.

Today, the selection of spruce trees in Finland is wide. Black spruce and Serbian spruce are also on sale, for example.

## The right size for a spruce

Spruce growers advise that you should buy a spruce of the appropriate size and shape for your home.

A narrow spruce tree, about 170 centimeters tall, is often suitable for an apartment building.

Finns buy tall and wide spruce trees for their detached houses. Some even buy spruce trees that are almost 3 meters tall.

## Spruce care

Spruce growers give two important pieces of advice to spruce buyers.

It is worth measuring the spruce tree's foot before buying, because the base of the spruce tree should not be too thick for the foot.

A spruce tree will stay fresh if it is given enough water. A spruce tree needs a lot of water, especially during the first day after it is brought inside.

## An important Christmas tradition

Growing a Christmas tree requires a lot of time and patience. It takes many years to grow a tree.

The demand for spruce trees varies from year to year.

Snowy Christmas weather increases sales of fir trees, but many Finns buy a fir tree even when there is no snow.

Christmas tree shopping is an important part of Christmas traditions in Finland.
