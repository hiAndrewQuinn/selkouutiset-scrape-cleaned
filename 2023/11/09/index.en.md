UN Human Rights Commissioner Volker Türk says that the terrorist organization Hamas and Israel have both committed war crimes.

The human rights commissioner says that Hamas and other Palestinian groups

Several salmiakki and licorice candies made in Finland contain a substance called Matriini, which is banned in the EU.

Yle commissioned a laboratory study of 10 Finnish candies. Too much matrine was found in 6 candies.

Matrine is in licorice extract, which is the raw material of candies.

It is not known for certain whether matrine is dangerous. That's why the EU has banned matriline just to be sure.

### High school students
