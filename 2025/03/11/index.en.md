## Members of Parliament in the spring elections

First, the election issue.

The majority of MPs are participating in the spring elections.

122 MPs are running in the municipal elections. 12 MPs are running in the regional elections. 39 MPs are running in both elections.

The majority of government ministers will also be participating in the spring elections.

Political scientist Johanna Vuorelma says it is not good if political power is concentrated in the hands of the same people. Vuorelma also wonders how MPs have enough time to also deal with regional and municipal politics.

Regional and municipal elections will be held on April 13.

## Strike in bakeries

Then the strike news.

The bakery strike started last night.

The strike affects approximately 150 bakeries, including Fazer, Vaasa and Lantm√§nnen Unibake bakeries. The strike will last 6 days.

There is a strike in bakeries because no agreement has been reached on a new collective bargaining agreement.

## Yo-writings and joint search

The spring matriculation exams have started today. The first was the native language and literature literacy test.

The joint search has also started today.

You can now apply to study at a university of applied sciences or university. You can apply for 6 different education programs.

## Condition of private roads

Finally, the topic is the condition of private roads.

20 percent of Finland's private roads are in poor condition.

The Finnish Forest Centre has conducted a survey of the condition of private roads for the first time. The survey examined how the road network can withstand, for example, a logging truck or a fire engine.

20 percent of private roads are in such poor condition that they need to be repaired immediately.

Private roads are small roads whose maintenance is the responsibility of road users, i.e. residents living along the road.

## Wednesday's weather

Forecast.

Tomorrow will be dry, meaning it won't rain. The sun will shine and warm.

It's a little bit cold during the day. It's a little bit warmer in the south. It's cold at night.
