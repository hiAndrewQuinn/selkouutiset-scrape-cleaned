## Crisis hotline

Initially, the topic is mental health.

Mieli ry's Crisis Hotline has been ringing frequently this summer. The crisis hotline was answered almost 21,000 times in June and July. The Crisis Chat service has also been busy.

The crisis line receives more than 20 calls every day from people with suicidal thoughts.

In Finland, approximately 750 people die by suicide each year. The number of suicides has been halved in 30 years.

## Prices of detached houses

Then we will talk about the prices of detached houses.

The prices of single-family homes have fallen significantly in Eastern Finland. Statistics Finland reports that in 10 years the value of old single-family homes in Eastern Finland has decreased by almost 25 percent.

Jonna Kiviaho is selling a detached house in Kerim√§ki, Savonlinna. In six months, she has received one phone call about it.

Prices of single-family homes have fallen and sales times have lengthened.

The situation in Eastern Finland is clearly worse than in the rest of the country. This is due, for example, to the fact that jobs in the forest industry have decreased and Russian tourists have disappeared.

## Jussi Halla-aho

More recent political history.

Former Finns Party chairman Jussi Halla-aho reveals why he left the party chairmanship.

Halla-aho announced in June 2021 that he would not continue as chairman of the Finns Party. He did not give a reason for his resignation at the time.

Halla-aho now says in a new biography that he was exhausted and depressed and disappointed in politics.

He also thought that the Finns' Party's cooperation with the National Coalition Party would be easier if someone else led the party.

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Friday.

It will rain in the northern part of the country. There may be a little rain in the southern and central parts of the country.

The temperature is between 8 and 17 degrees.
