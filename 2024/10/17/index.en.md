Pharmaceutical factory. Male gynecologists. Police electric motorcycles. Weather.

## Pharmaceutical factory

First we visit a pharmaceutical factory.

Most of the world's pharmaceuticals are manufactured in Asia.

However, this factory is in Finland, in Hanko.

The factory produces, for example, pharmaceuticals that are needed in the treatment of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease.

Most of the world's pharmaceuticals are manufactured in Asia.

However, it is important that pharmaceuticals are also manufactured in Finland.

In a crisis situation, medicines may not be able to get from Asia to Finland and the rest of Europe.

## Male gynecologists

Then the topic is gynecologists, i.e. gynecologists.

The number of male gynecologists is decreasing.

About 30 years ago, most gynecologists were men. Now there are few male gynecologists left.

 Doctor **Juuso Isotalo** works at Turku University Central Hospital. He is currently the only male doctor in Turku who is specializing in gynecology and childbirth.

Male doctors do not come to gynecology because some patients do not want a male gynecologist.

(**Mikael Huhtala**, gynecologist)

*- The patient may say that he is nervous about being a male doctor, or is not used to being a male gynecologist. Or he might say that it is not part of his culture for a male doctor to examine a woman.*

The number of male gynecologists is decreasing.

Male doctors experience difficult situations already during their studies.

Professor **Päivi Polo** says that women don't always want to be studied by male students.

## Police electric motorcycles

Then the matter of police work.

The police are testing electric motorcycles.

An electric motorcycle is a better option for the environment than a motorcycle that runs on gasoline.

That's why the police are testing how well the electric motorcycle fits the police's work.

Criminal police constable **Tuomo Seppä** says that the electric motorcycle is well suited for monitoring tasks among people.

However, the speed of an electric motorcycle on the highway is not always fast enough.

The maximum speed of this model is 170 kilometers per hour.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow the sun will shine in the east and in western and northern Lapland.

The rest of the country is mostly cloudy. It rains a little in places.

The temperature is over 10 degrees in the southern and central part of the country. It's cooler in the north.
