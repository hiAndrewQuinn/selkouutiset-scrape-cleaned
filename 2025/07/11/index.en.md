Summer cottages. Wetland rafts. Luxury cruise ship. Weather.

## Summer cottages

First, news about summer cottages.

Finns spend less money on summer cottages than before.

A report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry shows that the average cost of spending on a cottage this year is just over 7,000 euros.

Most of the money goes to renovations and grocery shopping, such as food and drink.

However, less money is spent on the cottage than before.

For example, about 1,000 euros less was spent on cottage renovations last year than 4 years earlier.

## Wetland rafts

Then the topic is the restoration of waterways.

In Eastern Finland, a trial is being conducted to restore waterways using a wetland raft.

Here, a wetland raft is being built using volunteer labor in Muuruvesi, Kuopio.

Netting is placed on the bottom of the raft, and hay, for example, is placed on top of it. Finally, plants are planted on the raft.

The raft is floated in the water, allowing the plants on the raft to collect nutrients from the lake. This means that, for example, fewer nutrients remain for the ciliate algae and the amount of algae in the lake decreases.

In Eastern Finland, waterways are being restored using a wetland raft.

A raft is an easy and cheap way to restore waterways. It can be anchored, for example, to the shore of a cottage.

## Luxury Cruiser

Finally, the topic is a new luxury cruiser.

The world's largest luxury cruise ship has been built at the Turku shipyard.

The ship named Star of the Seas has been delivered to the customer, Royal Caribbean Cruises.

The ship can accommodate up to 7,000 passengers and has over 2,000 crew members.

For example, the ship has over 20 restaurants, 6 water slides and a simulator where you can surf.

The ship's home port is in Florida, USA. The ship will depart on its first cruise in August.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Saturday, the sun will shine almost all over the country.

Thunderstorms in the south. It may rain in the north.

The temperature is 19-27 degrees.
