## Strikes

First the strike news.

Strikes in the technology and chemical industries continue today.

This time the strike will last 5 days. It affects over a hundred locations and approximately 8,000 employees.

Industrial workers are striking because negotiations on a new collective agreement are stalled.

The workers' organization, the Finnish Confederation of Industry, rejected the national mediator's settlement proposal yesterday. The Finnish Confederation of Industry said that the wage increases in the proposal were too small.

## Summer jobs

Then the topic is summer jobs.

Many employers are now looking for employees for the summer. The busiest application period is from January to March.

Finding the right employee can be difficult when there are many applicants.

The majority of employers ask applicants for a cover letter and a CV.

Some employers have created their own application forms, which are then used to select applicants for interviews.

There are other ways.

For example, in Nurmijärvi, summer workers for the library or other municipal tasks are selected by lottery.
