## Phishing of bank details

First, news about online scams.

Fraudsters are fishing for bank information a lot now. The scams are so clever that even a digitally savvy person doesn't always notice them.

The scam comes, for example, via text message.

The most important instructions are: Do not open strange links. Never enter your bank account number on an unknown site.

Even so, tens of millions of euros are lost to scams every year.

There is a lot of fishing for bank information now.

Disputes about compensation can end up in court proceedings. The responsibility is transferred to the consumer if he had the opportunity to notice that it is a scam. The consumer must make sure that he is working on the right website, not on a scam website.

Criminals' number one method of phishing is to appeal to urgency.

## Lava eruption in Iceland

Then about the volcanoes of Iceland.

In Iceland, a lava eruption has damaged the coastal town of Grindavik. Lava has flowed into the city and set fire to at least 3 residential buildings.

The eruption started yesterday, but now it has calmed down.

Grindavik, with about 4,000 inhabitants, has been evacuated, and there are no people in danger.

Officials say that the last such serious eruption was in Iceland in the 1970s.

## King and Queen of Denmark

Finally, about the Danish monarchy.

Denmark now has a new king.

Power changed when 83-year-old Queen Margaret abdicated. He confirmed the waiver with a signature to the government.

Crown Prince Frederik became King Frederik the Tenth of Denmark. The Queen of Denmark is now Mary.

The royal family is very popular in Denmark. The king has no power, but he is an important symbol for Danes.

The website of Selkouutinen has a lot of information about the new king and other Nordic countries.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

It's freezing all over Finland. It's windy, so the frost is biting. It is coldest in the north.

It snows a little in the east and north.
