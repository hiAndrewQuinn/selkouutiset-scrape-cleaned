Visits to a private general practitioner. Christmas greetings from the presidential couple. Bright light therapy. Thursday's weather.

## Visits to the general practitioner

First, news about healthcare.

Pensioners' visits to general practitioners may increase, according to a Kela specialist researcher.

The government plans to make a visit to a private general practitioner the same cost for people over 65 as a visit to a health centre general practitioner. The fee will be 28 euros next year.

If the plan is implemented, low-income pensioners will also be able to use private medical services.

Therefore, the number of visits to general practitioners by pensioners may increase.

## Christmas greetings from the presidential couple

Then the topic was Christmas greetings to the presidential couple.

The presidential couple has received Christmas greetings.

President **Alexander Stubb** and the President's spouse **Suzanne Innes-Stubb** received Christmas greetings today at the President's official residence.

The Lucia maiden **Daniela Owusu** performed at the event.

The president encouraged Lucia. Owusu is Finland's first brown Lucia, and she has received a lot of racist comments. It's wrong, Stubb said.

The presidential couple has received Christmas greetings.

Forestry students brought a Christmas tree to the presidential couple.

The presidential couple also got a Christmas fish. The Christmas pike is an old tradition.

## Bright light therapy

Then the topic of bright light therapy.

Bright light therapy helps with winter depression.

This is what research professor **Timo Partonen** says.

Many people feel unwell in the darkness of winter. They become tired, gain weight and sleep poorly.

Partonen says that bright light therapy is the best treatment for these symptoms.

So bright light therapy helps with winter depression.

Bright light therapy is used every morning, for example for half an hour.

You can read and eat breakfast in the light of a bright light bulb, but it is not good to look directly into the light.

In just 2 weeks, your mood and sleep will improve.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will rain tomorrow. It will snow in a large part of Finland. It will snow a lot in the north.

In the north it is 5-25 degrees below zero. The wind makes the cold feel worse.

It's raining in the south. The temperature is slightly above zero.
