## Home in Argentina

Pope Francis' real name was Jorge Mario Bergoglio.

He was born in 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bergoglio's parents were immigrants. They came to Argentina from Italy.

Bergoglio became pope in March 2013. He was pope for 12 years.

Bergoglio chose the papal name Francis. Francis of Assisi was an Italian monk and saint who lived in the 13th century.

## The disadvantaged and marginalized

Pope Francis was the first South American pope.

He steered the Catholic Church in a more modern direction. For example, he spoke more positively about homosexuals than previous popes. He also somewhat improved the status of women in the Catholic Church.

The disadvantaged and marginalized were important to Francis.

Francis's speeches often focused on the marginalized, the poor, the sick, migrants, and prisoners. Francis also visited migrants and prisons.

Pope Francis spoke cautiously about the war in Ukraine. For example, he did not condemn Russian war crimes in Ukraine. This caution has angered many people.
