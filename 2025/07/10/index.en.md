## Finnish bioglass repairs bone

First, some news about medicine.

Finnish bioglass has been used in Ukraine to treat infections. Hundreds of patients have already received treatment.

Bioglass is a material that replaces bone. Bioglass can prevent the spread of infections.

In war zones, there is a risk that antibiotics will not be effective or may not even be available.

Sometimes the injuries are so severe that part of the bone is completely destroyed. Bioglass has repaired the bone.

Finnish bioglass has been used in Ukraine to treat infections.

Health technology company Bonalive is seeking international markets with bioglass.

Bioglass reduces the need for antibiotics.

Antibiotic resistance is a problem worldwide. Resistance means that bacteria have the ability to resist an antibiotic.

Resistance could cause more than 10 million deaths by 2050.

## Youth gap years

Then there's the matter of the so-called gap year.

Over 90,000 young people were left without a place to study at a higher education institution in the second joint application in the spring.

Martina Gurvits studied for 1200 hours in 9 months for the entrance exams. She still didn't get to study to become a doctor.

Toivo Antikainen has been studying to be a nurse for the last year. He wants to change his field and study to be a physiotherapist. He is currently collecting credits in open studies.

A large number of young people go to work during their gap year. However, there are now fewer jobs and more applicants.

## Heat record

Finally, the weather report.

June was the warmest on record in Western Europe, according to the European Union Climate Service.

In western Europe, the average temperature in June was over 20 degrees Celsius. This is almost 3 degrees Celsius higher than the average for the reference period.

Globally, June was the third warmest on record.

## Weather
