Demonstration. Strikes. Slippage. Weather.

## Demonstration

First, news about the demonstration.

There was a big demonstration in Helsinki today.

The name of the demonstration was STOP Now.

The workers' organizations organized the demonstration because they want to stop the government's plans.

This is how Leo Hara, the chief trustee:

*- Yes, irritation and anger, those feelings are at the top. Before the elections, all parties promised that the poor would not be cut. But it is now that (the governing parties) Perusfinomaliset and the coalition have betrayed their dunars (= employees).*

The government intends to weaken social security and workers' rights.

For example, the government intends to change the rules of sick leave so that the employee will no longer receive a salary from the first day of sick leave.

In addition, the government plans to make it easier to fire an employee.

The government also plans to limit the right of workers to organize strikes.

There was a big demonstration in Helsinki today against the government's plans.

Buses brought people from different parts of Finland to the demonstration.

## Strikes

Then the strike news.

Strikes continue in Finland.

The strikes are a protest against the government's plans.

Many employees are on strike, meaning they will not work today Thursday or tomorrow Friday.

Strikes continue in Finland.

Today, Thursday, some shops are closed due to the strike.

Air traffic also stops almost completely on Thursday and Friday.

On Friday, buses also stop at least in the Helsinki region, Turku and Tampere.

Trains, trams and the metro also do not run on Friday.

## Slippage

Finally, the topic is slippery weather.

The streets are really slippery now.

The temperature is sometimes on the positive side and sometimes on the freezing side.

Water enters the streets, which then freezes again.

The street is particularly slippery when there is water on top of the ice.

Such slip barriers can be attached to shoe soles.

They help the walker stay upright on the icy street.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

It will be sunny in many places on Friday.

The temperature is between 0 and -10 degrees, in the north it is colder in places.
