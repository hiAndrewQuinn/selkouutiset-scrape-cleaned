## Labor tax credits

The government has decided on a big tax cut for employees and companies. The aim is to accelerate economic growth.

Taxation on labor will be reduced by approximately one billion euros over the next year and the following year.

For example, if a person's salary is 3,000 euros per month, they will have about 380 euros more money per year than they have now.

The child allowance for tax deductions will be increased by 100 million euros. This will reduce the tax burden on families with children.

Taxation on large annual incomes of over 100,000 euros will also be significantly reduced.

## Corporate tax breaks

Corporate tax for companies is being calculated.

The purpose is to support entrepreneurship and the operations of companies. The purpose is to attract foreign investments into companies in Finland.

Corporate tax is a tax that companies pay on their profits.

Corporate income tax will decrease from 20 percent to 18 percent in 2027. The change is significant. It will reduce tax revenues by 830 million euros.

The intention is that tax revenue will increase later if investments come to Finland and the economy improves.

The calculation of corporate income tax also attracts criticism.

Economics professor **Jarkko Harju** says that the corporate tax cut may not increase investments in Finland.

This is what studies on Finland's previous tax reforms show.
