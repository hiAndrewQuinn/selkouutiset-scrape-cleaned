## Social justice

First, news about Finnish municipalities.

A new study ranks municipalities based on social justice.

The best municipality is Pedersören in Ostrobothnia. People there are doing well, there is little unemployment, and the municipality is safe.

Other best municipalities are Mustasaari and Lieto.

There are many good municipalities in Western Finland.

There are many municipalities in a poor situation in Central Finland, Northern Savo and North Karelia.

The reason for the poor situation is often high unemployment.
