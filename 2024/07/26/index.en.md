Celiac disease. Blue-green algae. Blueberry harvest. Weather.

## Celiac disease

First the medical news.

Celiac disease is becoming more common in Finland.

Celiac disease is an intestinal disease. The patient's intestine cannot tolerate gluten, which is in cereal products. Symptoms include, for example, stomach pain and diarrhea.

A new study shows that celiac disease is increasing in Finland. There is already more celiac disease in Finland than in many other countries.

The most important treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. There is still no cure for celiac disease.

In Finland, celiac disease is becoming more common.

Attempts are being made to develop drugs against celiac disease.

Good results have been obtained, for example, at the University of Tampere. The university estimates that the new drug will be available to patients in maybe 5 years.

## Blue-green algae

Then the topic is blue-green algae.

There is a lot of blue-green algae on the beaches now.

Blue-green algae is a bacterium that produces toxic substances in water.

The Environmental Center says that the algae situation on the seashores is now worse than usual.

The algae situation in the lakes is better. The rains and winds have broken up the algae rafts in the lakes.

However, there is a lot of blue-green algae on the seashores.

It has also harmed swimming schools.

For example, in Parain, the swimming school has changed locations if blue-green algae has entered the water.

Sometimes the students have not gone into the water at all, but have practiced swimming moves on dry land.

## Blueberry harvest

Then the topic is blueberry.

This summer's blueberry crop is good.

Next winter, however, there may be a shortage of frozen blueberries in stores.

The reason is that there are too few berry pickers now. Foreign pickers have at least not yet been brought to Finland.

In previous summers, many Thai berry pickers have come to Finland.

This summer's blueberry crop is good.

More than 500 million kilograms of berries grow in Finnish forests every year.

Finns also eat a lot of berries. Every Finn eats an average of 8 kilos of berries per year.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Saturday, the weather will continue to be the same as the last few days.

It's raining and thundering in the east. Elsewhere it is more powdery.

The weather is warm and hot. The temperature is 20-28 degrees.
