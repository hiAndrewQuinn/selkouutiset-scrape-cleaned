Mental health problems are common. The most common mental health problem is depression. Research shows that 20 percent of Finnish people will suffer from depression at some point in their lives.

Experts say that mental health needs to be talked about more than before. Mental health problems are often associated with shame, which may prevent people from seeking help in a timely manner.

It is worth seeking help for various mental health problems.

Mental health problems can be helped at a health center. For example, therapy often helps with depression. Therapy is a talk therapy that aims to make a person feel better.

Sometimes medication is also needed for mental health treatment. Serious mental health problems are treated in a hospital.

Sometimes a person can feel so bad that help is needed immediately.

For example, you can get help by calling the crisis line. Mieli ry's crisis line has received a lot of calls this summer. The crisis line receives over 20 calls every day from people who have suicidal thoughts.

If a person is having serious suicidal thoughts, they should call the emergency center.
