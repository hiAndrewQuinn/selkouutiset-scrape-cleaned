Tax information for 2022 is now public. The tax data shows which people received the most money last year in salary income and capital income.

Mikko Kuusi made the most money in Finland last year. He got a lot of money when the food delivery service Wolt was sold abroad. Mikko Kuusi earned a total of 79.5 million euros in 2022.

Tax data show that a large proportion of people who earn a lot are men. Among the 1,000 people who made the most money last year, about 15 percent were women.

This week there has been a lot of talk about the fact that many dogs got sick from dog food. It has now become clear that the cause may be a foreign potato flake.

The pet supply company Musti Group says that the dogs may have been poisoned by a foreign potato flake. Potato flakes have been in Musti Group's cat food and dog food. The food is suspected to have caused many dogs, for example, nausea.

Many people have taken their dog to the vet when it got sick from dog food. Musti Group promises to pay these vet bills.

The Food Agency is investigating samples taken from Musti Group's dog food.

### EU membership negotiations

The European Commission recommends that the EU start negotiations with Ukraine on the country's EU membership. However, Ukraine must first fulfill some membership conditions. The Commission hopes that Ukraine will take more measures against corruption, for example.

The EU Commission also recommends that membership negotiations begin with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Moldova.

There are currently 27 countries in the European Union.
