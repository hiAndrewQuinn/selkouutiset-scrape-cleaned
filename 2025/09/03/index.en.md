## The government completed the budget

First, news about the Finnish state budget.

Yesterday, the government agreed on the state budget for next year. The government agreed on how the state will receive money and how it will spend it.

The state will receive money when the government saves an additional over a billion euros.

The government saves money when it pays less in subsidies. The government reduces subsidies for, for example, the construction of cheap rental housing. It also reduces subsidies for the integration of immigrants and development cooperation.

However, the savings are not enough. The government is short of almost 9 billion euros in the budget. Therefore, the state is forced to take on more debt.

## ADHD medication shortage

Next, news about ADHD medications.

Some ADHD medications are out of stock in pharmacies. ADHD medications help people with disorders of activity and attention.

Pharmacies are running out of popular ADHD medications in particular. If your medication is out of stock, the pharmacy may be able to substitute it with another ADHD medication.

However, some ADHD medications cannot be replaced by the pharmacy. In such cases, the customer must obtain a new prescription from the doctor.

ADHD medications may be more readily available again in October, estimates the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea.
