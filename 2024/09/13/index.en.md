## Yle's financing

First, news about politics.

The parliamentary parties have reached an agreement on Yle's funding cuts.

Yle's value added tax will rise from 10 to 14 percent.\
Therefore, Yle's tax expenses are increasing and there is less money left for operations than before.

Yle's funding increases will be stopped for several years. That's why Yle's funding is reduced, because the expenses rise every year.

The parliamentary parties have reached an agreement on Yle's funding cuts.

The working group of the parties negotiated the issue for many months.

The cuts in Yle's funding total 66 million euros.
