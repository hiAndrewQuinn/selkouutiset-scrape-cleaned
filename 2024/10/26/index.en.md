Winter driving

In the news week, this time we talk about winter driving.

Now is the time to change the car's winter tires. The law says that the car must have winter tires from November onwards, if the weather requires it.

Now we will tell you more about driving in winter.

## Winter tires less than in November

Now is the time to change the car's winter tires.

November starts next week, and the weather forecast says that the weather will also get colder next week. At the end of the week, it may also snow all over the country. The driving weather can therefore turn into winter, and then the car must have winter tires.

Finnish law says that the car must have winter tires from November to the end of March, if the weather or driving conditions require it. You can also drive on winter tires at other times if the weather is slippery.

## Studded tires are the most popular

In Finnish winter weather, cars use two types of winter tires, studded tires or friction tires.

Friction tires have become more common in recent years, but studded tires are still used more. Especially on icy and slippery roads, studded tires hold better.

The law says that the main grooves of winter tires must be at least 3 millimeters deep. However, it is recommended that the grooves be at least 5 millimeters deep in winter weather.

This fall, motorists must be careful with friction tires.

The so-called mountain marking must now be found on the friction tires. The label has three mountain peaks and a snowflake.

The marking means that the tire is approved for demanding winter weather.

## Winter speed limits in effect

Motorists should also note that road traffic is now moving to winter speeds. It means that you have to drive slower in winter than in summer.

Speed limits on roads are mostly 80 kilometers per hour in winter and 100 kilometers per hour on highways.

## Repeat

In the news week, this time we talked about winter driving. Let's summarize the most important things.

Cars must have winter tires from November onwards, if the driving weather requires it.

The main groove of a winter tire must be at least 3 millimeters deep.

Friction tires must have a so-called mountain marking, which means that the tire is approved for demanding winter weather.

On the roads, we now switch to winter speeds.
