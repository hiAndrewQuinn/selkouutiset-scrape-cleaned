Job postings. Elections. Advertising. Tuesday's weather.

## Job postings

First, news about job advertisements.

Recruitment firms copy companies' job advertisements.

This is according to a Yle report.

When a company is looking for an employee, it publishes an advertisement on the Job Market.

Some recruitment companies then start looking for employees for the company even though the company has not requested one.

The purpose of recruitment companies is to receive a fee if they find a suitable employee for the company.

This surprises companies.

For example, a construction company in Helsinki was looking for an electrician. The recruiter also saw an advertisement for the same job from a recruitment company.

CEO **Marti Udos** is amazed.

*"They just directly copied our ad and probably tried to hunt down employees for us and get a recruitment fee for it."*

*What is democracy?*

*In a democracy, the rules are agreed upon together.*

*Finland is a democratic country.*

*In Finland, common rules aim for a good life.*

*In a democracy, no one decides alone.*

*The rules are decided together.*

*What do you need for a good life?*

Many foreigners who have lived in Finland for a long enough time are also allowed to vote in regional and municipal elections.

## Advertising and consumption

Now for some news about consumption.

The study recommends that advertising should be limited.

Advertising increases people's overconsumption. Advertising creates needs in people.

Advertising is clever. For example, on social media, advertising can look like good recommendations.

Advertising gives the feeling that people must have certain items, clothes or toys.

**Sonja Holopainen** studies consumption and sustainability.

Holopainen's research shows that if advertising is reduced, overconsumption will decrease.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will vary on Tuesday.

It may rain and sleet in the north.

Elsewhere it is cloudy and the sun is shining.

The temperature is about +8 degrees in the south and about +4 degrees in the north.
