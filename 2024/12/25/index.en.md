Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** invited the prime ministers of Sweden, Italy and Greece, as well as **Kaja Kallas**, who heads the EU's foreign policy, to Finland.

The leaders discussed in particular European security.

Italian Prime Minister **Giorgia Meloni** said that Russia and criminal organizations are trying to cause problems for the EU through immigration. That is why defending the EU's external borders is important.

They also got to know the nature of Lapland.

## Fire safety

Then the topic of fire safety.

Fire safety is important at Christmas.

There are a lot of Christmas lights in homes and extension cords for them.

Fire Chief **Claes Tallberg** says that extension cords must be in good condition to be used safely.

The risk of fire in the kitchen increases if there is a lot of stuff and dirt on the surfaces.

Fire safety must be remembered at Christmas.

Homes must have smoke alarms.

A fire blanket can be used to extinguish, for example, a boiler that catches fire.

And there are different sizes of fire extinguishers, Tallberg says.

## Vegetarian food at Christmas

Then the topic is Christmas food.

Vegetarian dishes are becoming increasingly popular at Christmas.

This is where food is prepared from vegetable caviar.

It looks and tastes similar to fish caviar, but it is made from seaweed.

Therefore, it is also suitable for people with fish allergies and contains no cholesterol.

Vegetarian dishes are becoming increasingly popular at Christmas.
