## Medical trial for people over 65

The topic of the news week is a medical experiment on people over 65.

In the experiment, people over 65 can visit a private general practitioner at a lower price.

The aim is to make it easier for the elderly to access treatment and reduce queues at health centers.

We will now tell you how many elderly people have used the experiment and what Kela says about the results.

## Number of users

The experiment began last summer.

The service has been used by approximately 15,000 Finns over the age of 65. The number is quite small.

In October, less than 13,000 people received compensation from Kela for the experiment. This is less than one percent of all people over 65 years old.

The experiment was most widely used in Central Finland, Satakunta and Western Uusimaa.

In Åland and Central Ostrobothnia, use was low.

## Price of visit

In the trial, elderly people can visit a private general practitioner 3 times a year. The cost of one visit is approximately 28 euros.

The elderly person pays half of the examinations and samples themselves and the other half is reimbursed by Kela.

The number of visits and price level are limited to ensure that costs do not increase too much.

## Service providers

Kela says that the experiment has started as Kela expected.

Kela Director General **Lasse Lehtonen** says that enough service providers have joined and people have been satisfied with the service.

Minister of Social Security **Sanni Grahn-Laasonen** says that the experiment can be developed if there is a need for it.

## Reasons for visiting a doctor

Kela's special researcher **Riina Hiltunen** says that the most common reasons for elderly people to visit a doctor are musculoskeletal diseases and hypertension.

Women use the service more than men.

Some customers report that it has been difficult to get doctor appointments for the trial.

There is little service available in Åland, Central Ostrobothnia and some other areas.

Kela says that the number of service providers has increased and usage has increased.

It is not yet known for sure how the experiment will affect queues at health centers.

Kela says that the experiment has helped many elderly people access treatment.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was Kela's new medical experiment for seniors over 65.

Only a small number of seniors have used the trial, but users have been satisfied with the service.

Kela and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health are monitoring the experiment.
