## Conversation of the Presidents

The most important part of President Stubb's visit to China was the meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The presidents talked for 3 hours.

The presidents talked a lot about Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine.

Stubb told Xi that Russia's attack on Ukraine is also a threat to Finland. Stubb also told Xi that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted.

Stubb said that he and X had a good conversation.

## China's relations with Russia

The presidents' discussion about Russia was important for Finland and the EU as a whole. It was important because China has not condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine.

China has maintained relations with Russia. Finland and other EU countries do not like that China has good relations with Russia.

President Stubb told Chinese President Xi that the relationship between Russia and China affects China's relationship with European countries.

## Visa exemption

President Stubb's visit to China was also attended by ministers from the Finnish government and managers from Finnish companies.

Cooperation agreements were concluded for Finnish and Chinese companies. For example, Finnish companies get permission to export chicken meat to China. The matter has been negotiated for 7 years.

Agreements were also made between Finland and China on the trade of battery materials.

China also granted visa freedom to Finland. In the future, Finns will be allowed to travel to China for a maximum of 15 days without a visa.
