## Ukraine peace plan

First, news about the Ukraine peace plan.

US-Russian cooperation on Ukraine is bad for Europe.
This is what the experts say.

The US and Russia have made a plan for Russia to return to the global economy.

More information about the plan has become public.

Sanctions on Russia will be lifted. Some Ukrainian territories will remain in Russia. Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO. War crimes will be pardoned.

US-Russian cooperation is a bad thing because the US is bypassing its European allies. This is according to international politics professor **Tuomas Forsberg.**

*"Well, this is a complete disaster. It's quite clear that the allies are being left as pawns or their positions are not being listened to at all."*
