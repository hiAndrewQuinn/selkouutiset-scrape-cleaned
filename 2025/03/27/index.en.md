## Yle's savings

Now the news from Yle.

Yle will reduce its TV and radio programs. There will also be changes to the programs.

The reason is the savings that Yle has to make.

Parliament has decided that Yle must save 66 million euros by 2027.

Yle's regional radio stations will be leaving their own presenters. However, regional journalists will continue to write stories for the regional radio stations.

For example, the radio will stop broadcasting the sports program *Ice Hockey Tour*. The radio will also stop broadcasting some music programs.

There will be changes to the television programs *Strömsö* and *Puoli Seitsemän*.

Yle CEO **Merja Ylä-Anttila** knows that the changes will upset Finns.

*"I am aware that these will lead to disappointment and sadness when my own mental program does not continue."*

Yle is reducing TV and radio programs due to savings.
