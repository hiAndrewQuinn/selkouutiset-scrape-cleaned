First, the news about the SDP harassment cases.

The SDP party leadership has held a crisis meeting this week because three of the party's MPs have treated parliamentary assistants inappropriately.

Inappropriate behavior has included, for example, inappropriate speech or touching.

Inappropriate treatment has perhaps occurred a few times over the past few years.

The chairwoman of the SDP parliamentary group **Tytti Tuppurainen** says that such actions must not continue.

The MPs have apologized for their bad behavior.

The SDP will commission an external investigation into the cases and then decide whether the MPs will be sanctioned.

## Children's use of digital devices

Now for some news about children's use of digital devices.

This week, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) issued new recommendations on the use of digital devices by children under the age of 13.

THL recommends that children under the age of 13 do not use smartphones or social media.

The recommendations are based on the wishes of experts and parents.

THL plans to later prepare recommendations for 14–18-year-olds as well.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has also previously proposed that social media be banned for those under 15 years of age.

## Disappearances of people with memory problems

The next topic is the disappearance of elderly people with dementia.

Experts say that the disappearances of the elderly and people with dementia are increasing in Finland.

The reason is that many frail elderly people live at home without sufficient assistance.

There have been several cases in Finland this winter where people with dementia have left home and even died because it is cold outside.

The police estimate that the number of missing persons cases will increase in the future as the population ages.

Researchers say that home care for the elderly is not sufficient. Researchers say that services need to be improved so that disappearances can be prevented.

## Ukraine peace talks
