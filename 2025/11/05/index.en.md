Data centers. Student loans. Eggs. Weather.

## Data centers

Initially, the topic is data centers.

Data centers can increase electricity prices in Finland, according to a new study examining the impacts of data centers.

The study indicates that the price of electricity could increase by perhaps around 10 percent if many more data centers are built in Finland.

There are currently dozens of data center projects underway in Finland.

Data centers consume a lot of electricity, which can increase the price of electricity.

The study says that Finland should support centers that bring new electricity production. They can also be flexible in electricity consumption when there is a shortage. Flexibility is needed, for example, in cold weather when there is little wind power.

## Student loans

Then we'll talk about student loans.

Students are increasingly taking out student loans.

In 2011, students took out loans worth an average of around 5,000 euros. Last academic year, loans totalled just under 13,000 euros, Kela says.

Students are taking out more and more student loans.

Last year, two out of three students had student loans when they graduated from college.

## Eggs

Then about the eggs.

Finns eat more eggs than before.

Finns eat an average of 4 eggs per week. This means that one person eats about 12 kilograms of eggs per year.

A record number of eggs will also be produced this year, totaling approximately 80 million kilograms.

Finns eat more eggs than before.

It used to be feared that eggs would raise cholesterol. Today, eggs are used to replace meat because they are high in protein.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be dry throughout the country, meaning it will not rain.

The sun shines in the central part of the country and in the western part of the country.

The temperature is +10 degrees in the south and +2 degrees in the north.
