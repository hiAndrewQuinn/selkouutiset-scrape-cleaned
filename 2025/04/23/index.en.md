Restaurants. Mobile home care. Drinks. Weather.

## New restaurants

First, from the restaurant industry.

Many new restaurants are still being opened, even though a record number of restaurants have closed this year.

Miki Puikkonen from Helsinki has dared to open a new restaurant. However, he has had to lower prices and increase portions.

*- 30 customers are enough for me to be profitable. 25 is already a nice break-even.*

*- Have you received any salary?*

*- Today I paid myself my first salary.*

New restaurants are being opened, even though the economic situation is poor.

The Mara Tourism and Restaurant Services Association believes that the decline in interest rates and wage increases will begin to increase the number of people visiting restaurants.

That's not the case yet.

## Traveling home care

Then home care.

There are too few family caregivers who travel for the elderly and sick.

A mobile caregiver comes to the client's home, for example during the caregiver's days off. In that case, the client does not need to be transferred elsewhere for care.

Jani Jääskeläinen lives at the home of Seppo Ross, a man with dementia, for 6 days a month. His wife is a caregiver, which allows him to take the days off that the law allows.

*- Here we have listened to Eino Grön's wish concert, listened to music, and cooked food.*

There are too few mobile family carers. The service is not available in every welfare area in Finland. Mobile family care began in Varkaus last autumn.

The service is not yet available in Helsinki.

The Finnish Family Care Association says that mobile home care brings savings.

## Starts

Finally, about the sale of alcohol.

Alko's monopoly divides opinions.

In Finland, alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of more than 8% may only be sold at Alko.

However, the Prime Minister's party, the Coalition Party, wants the wines in grocery stores.

Alko and many customers say that Alko is still a good thing.

Kristian Penttinen believes that you don't get the same kind of advice in a grocery store as you do at Alko.

Well over half of Alko's sales come from wines.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is breezy on Thursday.

Cloudiness varies across the country, but the sun may shine.

Sleet and snow may fall in Western Lapland.

The temperature is around 2 - 8 degrees. It can be freezing in the north.
