EU defense. Candidate disappearance in municipal elections. Linda Lampenius. Weather.

## EU defense

First, security policy.

EU leaders have decided to strengthen EU defense.

The decision was made this evening at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

The plan directs approximately 800 billion euros to the defense of EU countries.

No new support was promised to Ukraine now, but its support was promised to be strengthened in the near future.

EU leaders have decided to strengthen the EU's defense.

EU countries must now improve their own security, as the US may no longer defend Europe in the future

Ukraine also now needs more support from Europe, as US support may be running out.

## Candidate disappearance in municipal elections

Then the topic is the municipal elections.

Parties have had difficulty finding candidates for the spring municipal elections.

In every fifth municipality, there are only slightly more candidates than there are seats on the municipal council.

The worst situation is in the small municipality of Pyhäranta in Southwest Finland.

There are 19 seats in the Pyhäranta municipal council and there are only 1.2 candidates per council seat.

So almost every candidate can get into the council.

Municipal elections will be held on April 13. Regional elections will also be held on the same day.

## Linda Lampenius

Then culture.

Finnish violinist Linda Lampenius is returning to pop music.

Lampenius performed at the New Music Competition in early February. The audience was thrilled.

Since then, Lampenius has received many performance offers.

Linda Lampenius came to public attention in the 1990s, when she pursued an international career.

In recent years he has lived in Sweden and focused on classical music.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will snow in the north tomorrow. Driving conditions may be poor.

The sun is shining in the south. It is warm in the south.

The weather is very windy, especially in central Finland.
