On Thursday, the strikes will stop train traffic and bus traffic on a large scale.

On Thursday, the trade unions will organize a strike in many sectors, because the trade unions do not like the government's labor market policy. The trade unions do not want the government to weaken working conditions or social security.

The strikes will affect the day of many Finns on Thursday. There are no buses, trams or metro in big cities.

Mail delivery also stops. The strikes on Thursday will also affect, for example, school meals and the cleaning of public spaces.

Finland is considering opening the eastern border. Foreign Minister **Elina Valtonen** says that Finland may be able to open the border gradually if Russia returns to normal operations.

Finland closed the eastern border because Russia started sending asylum seekers to Finland. Finland can open the border if Russia stops sending asylum seekers to the border.

The decision to close the eastern border ends on Thursday. The government must decide at the beginning of the week whether Finland will continue to close the border or whether Finland will open the border.
