Antti Pelttari. Digital wallet. Midsummer. Thursday's weather.

## Antti Pelttari

First, news from Parliament.

The Parliament has suspended the Secretary General of the Parliament, **Antti Pelttari**.

Pelttari is not allowed to work as Secretary General for the time being.

The reason is suspicion of a crime. Pelttari may have committed a crime in his previous job, when he was the head of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service.

The police suspect that Pelttari disclosed security secrets to the Security Police assistants, who are not allowed to disclose security secrets.

Pelttari may also have provided false information to the court.

The Parliament has suspended Secretary General Antti Pelttari from his post.

The Speaker of the Parliament **Jussi Halla-aho** announced the matter yesterday.

*"The Parliamentary Secretariat Committee has decided at today's meeting to suspend Secretary General Antti Pelttari from his duties."*

## Digital wallet

Now about mobile phones.

For many Finns, a mobile phone is also a wallet.

Credit cards can be saved in your mobile phone's wallet app.

You can buy bus tickets with your mobile phone and pay at the store's cash register.

The use of mobile phones as wallets is increasing, which is why data security is important.

Leading financial expert **Peter Jansson** advises that you should have different passwords for your screen lock and phone apps.

It is also a good idea to write down your phone's serial number, or IMEI code. This code can be used to lock your phone if it is stolen.

When your phone is well protected, it is a safe wallet.

The use of mobile phones as wallets is increasing.

The EU has also decided to introduce digital driving licenses.
