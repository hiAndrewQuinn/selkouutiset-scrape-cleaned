In the USA, a presidential election will be held in November of this year. Either Joe Biden or Donald Trump will probably be elected president.

Donald Trump's sentence may affect the US presidential election. Trump's chance of winning the election is perhaps a little lower than before.

There are 2 major parties in the USA, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. President Joe Biden is a Democrat and Donald Trump is a Republican. Republicans and Democrats think differently about many things.

## A divided US

In the USA, many people think that the political system does not work. People do not believe that the judiciary is impartial. Many people do not trust the media.

Donald Trump still claims that he won the presidential election in 2020. Actually, Trump lost the election. Many Trump supporters think that the election victory was stolen from Trump.

Experts believe that the mood in the USA will tighten before the November elections.

Former US President Donald Trump was found guilty of a crime this week. Experts believe that Trump's verdict will affect the US presidential election, which is in November. Donald Trump sharply divides people's opinions in the USA.
