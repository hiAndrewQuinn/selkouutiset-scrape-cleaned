## Ukraine's counterattack on Russia

The topic of the news week is Ukraine's attack on Russia's Kursk.

Ukraine has captured an area in Kursk in southwestern Russia from Russia. It is historical that some country has invaded Russian soil. We will now tell you more about the situation of the war in Ukraine.

## Kursk region

Ukraine launched a counterattack on Kursk on August 6th, almost 2 weeks ago. Ukraine says that it has already occupied more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory in Russia. The area is a bit bigger than, for example, Helsinki and Vantaa combined in Finland.

Ukraine says it has taken over more than 80 population centers in Russia.

Ukraine says it has also taken prisoners of war from Russia. Ukraine may exchange prisoners of war with Russia.

## Reasons for the attack

There could be many reasons for Ukraine's attack on Russia.

One reason is psychological. This is what military science docent **Ilmari Käihkö** says.

Many Ukrainians are tired of the war. With the attack, Ukraine strengthens the Ukrainians' morale and will to fight. Ukraine shows Ukrainians and Western countries that Ukraine can fight, and that the fight is worth continuing.

To the Russians, Ukraine wants to show that Russia should not continue the war.

Another reason may be tactical. Ukraine may want Russia to move troops from other fronts to Kursk.

The third reason could be that seizing the region from Russia will improve Ukraine's position if the two countries start peace talks.

## Historic attack

Ukraine's attack on Russia is historic. No country has invaded Russian territory since World War II.

The situation is humiliating for the Russian military leadership and President Vladimir Putin.

War is also becoming more common in Russians' everyday life. Russia has had to move people to safety from the Kursk region.

Russians' dissatisfaction with the country's leaders is growing.

Finland and other Western countries accept Ukraine's counter-attack on Russia, because Russia has attacked Ukraine first. Western countries accept that Ukraine may use weapons provided by Western countries in the attack.
