The recovery of the Finnish economy has been long awaited.

Back in the spring, many economic experts predicted that the Finnish economy would grow by more than one percent this year. Now, the forecasts have been revised downwards.

New forecasts show that Finland's economic growth will be less than one percent this year. For example, the Bank of Finland predicts that the Finnish economy will grow by only 0.3 percent this year.

## The future is uncertain

Experts say that Finland's economic growth is currently being held back by people not wanting to spend money. People are afraid to buy cars, apartments or services because the future feels uncertain.

People are worried about the world situation. For example, they are worried about the war in Ukraine continuing.

People are also worried about the situation at home. The number of unemployed people is growing, and many fear that they will become unemployed themselves. Statistics Finland says that in August there were already almost 270,000 unemployed people.

At the same time, the government has made big savings and cut social security, for example.

## Better to save than to spend

When the future feels uncertain, people find it better to save than to spend.

The Bank of Finland says that households now have more money in bank accounts than ever before. At the end of June, households had almost 115 billion euros in savings. People have also invested more money in shares and funds than before.

Experts say that when households start using their savings, the Finnish economy will also pick up.

## Repetition

The topic of this week's news was Finland's economic growth. Let's recap a few things.

Finland's economic growth is very slow.

Economic growth is being slowed down by the fact that Finns now prefer to save money rather than spend it.

Households are saving a record amount of money.

People think saving makes sense now because the situation around the world and at home feels uncertain.

That's all - see you again tomorrow.
