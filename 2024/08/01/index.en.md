## Care homes

First, news about nursing homes.

In the future, nursing homes may have fewer caregivers than today.

The reason is that the government plans to change the law on the number of caregivers. That law determines how many nurses there must be in nursing homes.

One of the reasons for reducing nurses is money. When nursing homes have fewer caregivers, less money is spent.

Another reason is that there are not enough nurses in all nursing homes these days.

## Finnish-Russian border

Then the news about the border between Finland and Russia.

Finland is preparing for the possibility that Russia will direct asylum seekers to Finland.

Russia can do that if it wants to cause trouble.
