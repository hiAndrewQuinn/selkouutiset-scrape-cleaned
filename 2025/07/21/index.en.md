## The Enforcement Agency collected false invoices

First, the news about false invoices.

Many people or companies have had to ask for their money back.

Some people don't know how to fix it.

## New group rescues in dangerous places

Next, news about a new rescue team.

A group specializing in dangerous situations has been started at the Helsinki Rescue Department.

A Rescue Task Force (RTF) can help patients in a dangerous location. For example, they can treat a victim who has been shot, even if the shooter is still at large in the area.

Previously, rescuers have had to wait for the police to declare the area safe.
