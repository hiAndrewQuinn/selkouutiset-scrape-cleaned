Terrible Harris. Medical certificate for a driver's license. Multilingual families.

## Terrible Harris

First, news about the US presidential election.

The Democratic Party's presidential candidate is likely to be Kamala Harris.

The Democrats will choose a presidential candidate in August, but Harris' choice already seems certain. Harris started the election campaign yesterday.

A new poll shows that Harris is slightly more popular than Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In the poll, 44 percent of Americans supported Harris, and 42 percent supported Trump.

Kamala Harris is becoming the Democratic Party's presidential candidate.

Harris is now President Joe Biden's Vice President.

Biden announced a couple of days ago that he will not be a candidate in the next election.

Biden is now endorsing Harris.

The US presidential election is in November.

## Medical opinion for a driver's license

Then the subject of the driver's license.

Many applicants for a driver's license need a medical certificate.

The applicant needs a statement from a doctor if he has an illness that may affect his ability to drive.

Such diseases include, for example, attention deficit disorder ADHD, depression and sleep apnea.

The doctor's report tells whether the applicant can drive a car safely.

Driver's license applicants may therefore need a doctor's report.

Not all drivers' license applicants remember this.

About 200 applicants a year do not get a medical certificate, even though they have an illness that can affect their ability to drive.

## Multilingual families

3 languages are spoken in this family.

Timo Suomi speaks Finnish to Ada's daughter, and Eva Suomi speaks Czech to Ada. The parents speak English to each other.
