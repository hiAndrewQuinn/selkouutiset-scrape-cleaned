Cable breaches. Poverty among families with children. Food shortages. Weather.

## Cable breach in court

First, the news about the cable breaks in the Gulf of Finland.

A trial has begun in the Helsinki District Court regarding cable violations in the Gulf of Finland.

Five telecommunications and electricity cables broke last Christmas Day. The cables ran on the seabed between Finland and Estonia.

The cables broke when the Eagle S ship dragged its anchor on the seabed for almost 100 kilometers.

The captain and two mates of the Eagle S ship have been charged with cable violations. They are accused of aggravated sabotage. The prosecutor is demanding a 2.5-year prison sentence for them.

The defendants say they have not committed a crime. They say the cables breaking was an accident.

## Poverty among families with children

Then the news about poverty among families with children.

Poverty among families with children is increasing more than previously estimated, says the National Institute for Health and Welfare. The reason for the impoverishment is the government's cuts to social security.

THL's new estimate is that 27,000 children will fall below the low-income threshold due to the surgeries.

Social security cuts are increasing poverty among families with children. Social assistance is not enough to compensate for the cuts the government has made to housing benefit and unemployment benefits.

## Beach trash

Then we'll talk about beach litter.

The most common piece of litter on Finnish beaches is cigarette butts. Nicotine sachets and snuff sachets are also increasingly found on beaches.

The Finnish Environment Institute regularly investigates the type of litter found on beaches. The latest observation was at Tulliniemi in Hanko.

In just over an hour, the researchers collect two bags of trash from the beach.

The most common type of litter on the beach is cigarette butts. The second most common type is plastic litter.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be unstable on Tuesday, meaning it may rain a little.

The temperature is around 10-17 degrees.
