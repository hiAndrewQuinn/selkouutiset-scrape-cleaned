Kela compensations

The topic of the news week this time is the Kela compensations, which the government plans to change. Kela reimbursement means that Kela reimburses part of the payment when a person visits a private doctor. Now we will tell you more about the government's plans.

The government intends to change Kela compensations. Social Security Minister Sanni Grahn-Laasonen told about the government's plans this week.

The biggest change concerns people of retirement age, i.e. over 65. The purpose is that a pensioner can see a private doctor at the same price as a health center. A visit to the health center will cost around 28 euros next year.

Minister Grahn-Laasonen says that it is an experiment. It will probably start in September next year.

If the experiment is successful, it can be extended to all ages. In the future, a visit to a private general practitioner will probably cost everyone the same as a visit to a health center.

## Visits to a specialist

The government plans to change other Kela compensations as well.

Kela compensations rise in services that are difficult for people to access in public health care, i.e. in a health center, for example.

The government's plan is that, for example, visits to the Ophthalmologist and dentist will start paying more Kela compensation than now.

The intention is that the new Kela compensations will come into force during the next year.

## Disputes between politicians

There are problems in Finnish healthcare.

Public health care is organized in welfare areas, but the welfare areas are running out of money. That is why services have to be reduced, and queues for doctors are growing.

Politicians argue about how to best solve problems. The government says that private health care is an important part of Finns' health care. That's why Kela compensations are also needed.

In the opinion of the opposition, the state should direct more money to public health care, not to Kela compensations, which benefit private health companies.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week this time was Kela compensations. Let's repeat the most important things.

The government intends to change Kela compensations.

The purpose is that senior citizens can see a private doctor cheaper than now.

In addition, Kela compensations increase for the services of some private specialists.

The government's goal is for people to get treatment quickly.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
