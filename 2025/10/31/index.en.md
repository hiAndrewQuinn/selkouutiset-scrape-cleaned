Lukoil and Teboil. Old invoices from Varhan. Trial rehabilitation of gravel roads. Weather.

## Lukoil and Teboil

Initially from Lukoil and Teboil.

Russian oil giant Lukoil sells international operations to energy company Gunvor.

Lukoil owns the Teboil chain, which also sells fuel in Finland.

Lukoil was subject to sanctions when Russia invaded Ukraine.

The sale of Lukoil could ease Teboil's situation, says Teboil trader **Marko Kauppinen**:

\- Good. That's what's expected in the merchant community.

Energy company Neste stopped fuel deliveries to Teboil due to sanctions.

A Teboil retailer says that card payments do not work at gas stations and fuel is now purchased with cash.

Lukoil's deal with Gunvor still needs approval from US sanctions authorities. Gunvor is owned by Swedish billionaire **Torbjörn Törnqvist.**

## Early interrupted billing

Then the news about the decline in welfare areas.

We reported on Tuesday that the Southwest Finland Welfare Region, or Varha, is sending people old invoices.

Varha has now stopped sending payment reminders. You can get 3 years of payment time for old payment reminders.

The chairwoman of the regional government **Niina Alho** says that not everyone has received the original invoice. The reason is being investigated.

Tens of thousands of people have received Varha's payment reminder for invoices that are many years old.

The total amount of the invoices is over 14 million euros.

Varha has now stopped sending payment reminders.

## Gravel road rehabilitation experiment

Finally, gravel roads.

Construction and renovation of gravel roads has been developed in Lapland. Gravel roads often suffer from frost damage.

During frost, the ground surface hardens and freezes. In spring, the ground softens again and the surface breaks.

In the experiment, cellulose fiber, which is used to make paper, was added to the surface layer of a gravel road.

The experiment has lasted for over 3 years, and the results are promising. The road has become more resistant to frost. The new method saves money and the environment.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

There will be plenty of clouds on Saturday. The day will be mostly sunny, but there may be a little rain.

It can be freezing in Lapland.

Elsewhere, the temperature is 1 - 7 degrees.
