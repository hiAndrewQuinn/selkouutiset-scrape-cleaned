## Eagle S ship

First, the news about cable breaks in the Baltic Sea.

The operation of the Eagle S ship in the event of cable breaches is unclear.

Cables were cut in the Baltic Sea at Christmas.\
The Finnish National Criminal Police (KRP) has investigated the Eagle S ship and its crew.

It has appeared in many ways that the ship intentionally broke the cables.

Yle has received information that the Finnish Security Intelligence Service may have other ideas.

The idea is that the ship accidentally broke the cables. The ship's anchor may have accidentally fallen and broken the cables.

The explanation puzzles the expert. If a ship is running with the anchor down, it affects the ship's course. The captain usually notices this.

The ship is still in Finnish waters in Porvoo.

Agricultural entrepreneur **Juha MÃ¤kinen** says the situation is unfair.
