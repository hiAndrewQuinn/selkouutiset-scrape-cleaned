## Home museums of the presidents

Then the topic is former presidents.

Finns are interested in former presidents.

Now the presidential election is increasing interest even more.

This is Tamminiemi in Helsinki.

Tamminiemi was the home of President Urho Kekkonen and Sylvi Kekkonen. Today, Tamminiemi is a museum.

It is said in Tamminiemi that visitors often ask why Urho and Sylvi Kekkonen had different bedrooms.

Finns are interested in presidents.

Here is the Mannerheim Museum in Helsinki.

The president and Marshal Mannerheim lived in the house. For example, Mannerheim's simple field bed always interests visitors.

## Finland by moving

Then the topic is the Finnish language.

You can also learn the Finnish language by moving around.

For example, Lappeenranta organizes sports for immigrants. Here we try snowshoes.

Everyone dares to speak Finnish in a group where we train and have fun together.

At the same time, immigrants get to know Finnish culture.

(Sofia Dilshat, Lappenranta)

*This is really fun. It's my first time trying these snowshoes. It's really nice.*

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is cooling down, i.e. warming up.

The snowstorm will be in the north tomorrow. 10 cm of snow may fall. In the south, it's already raining, so it's not raining.

Tomorrow it will be really wet and the ground will be slippery.
