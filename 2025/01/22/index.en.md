## Donald Trump

First, news from abroad.

The new US President **Donald Trump** may increase sanctions against Russia. Trump spoke to reporters at the presidential residence.

Trump said he may increase sanctions if Russia does not negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

The new US administration is preparing a meeting for Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has also signaled that a meeting is possible.

US President Donald Trump may increase sanctions against Russia.

European countries fear that Trump will reduce US support for Ukraine.

## Pensions

Now the news about pensions.

The labor market organizations have agreed on reforms to the pension system.

Pensions will be indexed. This means that index increases will be reduced if inflation is high.

Otherwise, there will be no major changes to pensions.

For example, pensions will not be cut.

The expert says that pensioners are the winners of the reform. A lot of surgeries have been performed in Finland, but pensioners are not being operated on.

This is what **Jukka Appelqvist**, Chief Economist of the Central Chamber of Commerce, says.

*"Recipients of earnings-related pensions are winners in that significant adjustment measures and cuts have been made in society in many directions, meaning that the trend continues that earnings-related pensions are practically outside the cuts."*

The labor market organizations have agreed on reforms to the pension system.

Parliament will decide on the reform later.
