School lunch. Scabies. An exhibition about the history of the Nordic region. Weather.

## School lunch

First, the topic is school food.

Many young people do not eat school meals.

School meals are free for students. However, more than half of the 8th and 9th grade students do not eat school food, perhaps several days a week.

Boys eat school food more often than girls. The gap between girls and boys has grown in recent years.

The data are from the school health survey.

Many young people therefore do not eat school meals.

Young people say that school food is often bad. School food tastes good to young people when it offers young people's favorite dishes.

Young people like to eat meat dishes. Young people don't like vegetarian food.

## Scabies

Then the matter of health.

The number of scabies cases is increasing.

Scabies is a skin rash. Its symptom is severe itching.

Scabies is caused by a very small mite that lives on human skin.

Scabies can be caught, for example, in kindergarten.

The number of scabies cases is increasing.

There are medicines to treat scabies, but they are expensive.

At least you don't get Kela reimbursement for scabies medicine yet.

[Uutisviikko in clear Finnish](https://yle.fi/a/74-20077411) tells more about scabies. The program can be found at yle.fi/selkouutiset, under All broadcasts.

## The history of Pohjola

Finally, we go to Sweden and Stockholm.

There is now a big exhibition about the history of the Nordic region in Stockholm.

The exhibition is the largest that Nordiska Museum has ever had. It tells about the inhabitants of Pohjola and life for 500 years.

Finland is part of the North, and it is reflected in the exhibition.

For example, there are objects from forest Finns on display. Mets√§ Finns moved to the forested areas of present-day Sweden and Norway already 500 years ago.

And here is Reijo. He moved to Sweden 50 years ago. Reijo and many other Finns then found work in Sweden.

The exhibition about the history of Pohjola has been of interest to the public.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is cloudy, i.e. without rain. It is sunny in the south and west.

In a large part of the country, the day is cloudy.

After the night of frost, the temperature rises above zero in almost the entire country.
