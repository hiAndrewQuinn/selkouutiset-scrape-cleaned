This week's news topic is data centers.

Many new data centers are currently being planned in Finland. For example, Chinese social media giant Tiktok plans to open a data center in Kouvola.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## Data centers across the country

The number of data centers in Finland is growing rapidly.

The Confederation of Finnish Industries says that last year it was informed of a total of 22 data center projects across the country. This year, the Confederation has already been informed of at least 15 new projects.

Data centers are needed to store and process the vast amounts of data on the internet. A data center, or server center, can be a room or building containing up to thousands of computers.

## Cheap electricity and cool climate

Many new data centers are coming to Finland.

Many international companies also want to bring a data center to Finland. Finland is of interest because of its cheap electricity and cool climate, as the computers and cooling in a data center require a lot of electricity.

There has been a lot of talk this week about a data center being built in Kouvola. The main user of the center will be the Chinese social media service Tiktok.

Kouvola has been delighted with the project, as it will create jobs for perhaps hundreds of people.

## Is Tiktok a security risk?

However, Minister of Economic Affairs Wille Rydman is concerned about Tiktok's data center. Rydman says the data center could be a security risk.

The EU fined TikTok for data breaches earlier this month, and police have previously warned that TikTok users' data could end up with Chinese security authorities.

However, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo says that Tiktok's data center is welcome in Finland.

Security expert Mikko Hyppönen says there is no need to worry about the data center. Tiktok's security threats do not depend on the location of the data centers.

## Repetition

Let's say it again.

Many data centers are now being built in Finland.

Cheap electricity and a cool climate attract data centers to Finland.

Chinese TikTok plans to open a data center in Kouvola.

A security expert says there are no security risks associated with Tiktok's data center.
