## Sweden's NATO membership

First, news about the defense alliance NATO.

Sweden will become a member of NATO in the coming days.

The Hungarian parliament approved Sweden's NATO membership yesterday. All other NATO countries have already accepted Sweden's NATO membership earlier.

Sweden will now be included in NATO's defense plans. It also improves Finland's security.

For example, Finland can get help from other NATO countries through Sweden if Russia attacks Finland. That is why it is really important for Finland that Sweden is part of NATO.
