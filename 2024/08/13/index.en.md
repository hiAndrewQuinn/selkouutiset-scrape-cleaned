## Marjafirma's trial

First, news about the trial.

A trial is being prepared in Lapland regarding the operations of a berry company.

Prosecutors are demanding prison terms for the manager of a Finnish berry company and the manager's Thai business partner.

According to the prosecutors, they have treated the Thai berry pickers so badly that we can talk about human trafficking.

Thai berry pickers have said that they lived in moldy premises in Finland and received spoiled food.

The berry pickers also say that they had to pay large compensations for bad services, but the berry company paid them too little for the berries.

A trial is being prepared in Lapland regarding the operations of a berry company.

The actual trial will probably start next May.

## Experiencing well-being

Then the topic is well-being and happiness.

Finns' experience of well-being and happiness has decreased.

In 2016, about 80 percent of survey respondents said that they experience happiness quite often or always.

About 6 years later, the number was only about 60 percent. Young people's experience of well-being in particular has decreased.

Finns therefore experience less well-being and happiness than before.

A new study says that there are many reasons for this, for example the corona pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine.

## New trolley line

Then the topic is the tram, or the trolley.

A new trolley line has been introduced in Helsinki.

Tram 13 started running yesterday. It runs between Kalasatama and Pasila.

The new trolley line therefore connects Kalasatama metro station and Pasila train station.

HSL believes that tram 13 will receive up to 5 million passengers per year.

A new trolley line was put into use in Helsinki yesterday.

Ratikka 13's first trip had many enthusiastic passengers. They wanted to experience the atmosphere of the new trolley.

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is sunny in a large part of the country. There may be thunderstorms in the southeast.

The weather is warm. The temperature is between 23 and 26 degrees.

The wind is weak to moderate.
