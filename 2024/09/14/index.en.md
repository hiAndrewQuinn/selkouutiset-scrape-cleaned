The political parties have agreed this week on Yle's money. The parties decided that Yle's money will decrease by millions of euros.

Yle's money decreases in 2 ways. Yle has to pay more taxes to the state than before. In addition, Yle's funding will not be increased for many years, even though expenses rise every year.

Thus, Yle's money will decrease by a total of 66 million euros. It means that Yle's income will decrease by about 10 percent.

## Negotiations between the parties

Yle is a public service media company. Yle's owner is the Finnish state, and Yle's money is decided by the parliament. That is why the parliamentary parties negotiated about Yle's money.

The parties' negotiations were not easy. The Yle working group of the parties met more than 30 times, and the work took longer than planned.

The parties disagreed on how much Yle's money should be reduced. In particular, Perussuomalaiset wanted to reduce Yle's money more than others.

However, it was important to the parties that Yle participate in the savings. Savings are now being made everywhere, because Finland's financial situation is bad.

Yle CEO Merja Yl√§-Anttila says that Yle wants to make the savings so that no audience group suffers too much from the savings.

## Ye's mission

Yelle has an important mission in Finland. Yle must strengthen democracy and Finnish culture and promote equality.

Yle makes programs for radio, television and the internet in many different languages. In addition to Finnish and Swedish, Yle also makes programs in minority languages.

This week, Yle reported that Yle will also start making news in Arabic and Somali. This is how Yle wants to improve the service for immigrants.

News in Arabic and Somali will start on September 23 on social media and Yle Areena.
