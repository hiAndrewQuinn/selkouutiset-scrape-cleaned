Ombudsman and complaints. Slippery. Athlete of the year. Saturday weather.

## Ombudsman and complaints

First, news about the Ombudsman.

The Parliamentary Ombudsman received over 7,000 complaints last year.

The number of complaints has increased. Complaints are made, for example, about cuts in social and health services.

The Ombudsman ensures that authorities comply with the law and that citizens' fundamental rights are respected.

**Jari Råman** took up the position of Ombudsman at the beginning of the year. Råman encourages people to file complaints:

– Well, if you feel that an authority has acted incorrectly, misused its discretion, or committed some illegal act, you can approach us with a low threshold.

## Slipperiness

Then there is the issue of slipperiness.

Roads and sidewalks may be very slippery in the coming days.

The weather is getting colder, meaning it's getting warmer. The Finnish Meteorological Institute warns that snow can make sidewalks very slippery. There may also be ice and water on the sidewalks.

Driving conditions may also be difficult over the weekend, with slippery road surfaces. In some places, freezing drizzle and more snow may fall.
