Finnish economy. Pensioners. Streams. Weather.

## Finnish economy

First, economic news.

The Finnish economy will grow next year. This is the assessment of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF predicts that the Finnish economy will grow by 1.5 percent next year.

The economy is growing because people are spending more money than before. Icebreakers, for example, will also improve the Finnish economy next year.

The IMF says that Finland's economy has been improving slowly. The organization also says that the Finnish government needs to save money in the future.

The Finnish economy will grow by 1.5 percent next year, the IMF estimates. The IMF predicts that the Finnish economy will also grow by 1.5 percent in 2027.

## Pensioners

The next topic is pensioners.

There are more people in Finland than ever before who have been retired for over 30 years. Almost 30,000 people have now been retired for over 30 years. In 20 years, there may be almost 100,000 of them.

-Even during working life, a person can build different hobbies for the future. I have many of them, but this is one.

There are more people in Finland who have been retired for over 30 years than before. People are living longer than before, so they are also retiring longer than before.

## Streams

Now the topic is nature.

The Water Act is poorly enforced in Finland. That's what experts say.

For example, the Water Act protects many small streams in forests. Yet streams are often destroyed when forests are cut down.

Experts believe that a request for investigation should be made to the police regarding violations of the Water Act. Small streams are important for maintaining the diversity of forest nature.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow, Wednesday, it will snow in the north. Driving conditions are very poor. In the south, it will be cloudy and the weather will warm up.
