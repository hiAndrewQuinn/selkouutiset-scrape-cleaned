The mines. Experience of society. Swedish lesson for police officers. Wednesday's weather.

## Mines

First, the topic is mines.

New mines are being planned for Finland.

Metals are obtained from the mines, which are needed for new environmentally friendly technology.

With the help of new technology, for example, we want to get rid of the use of oil and coal.

Many metals are obtained from China, for example, but Europe also needs its own metal production.

That is why new mines are being planned in Finland.

However, many are worried about how mines affect nature.

Here you can see traces of an old closed mine. There are still poisons in nature.

Mining companies say that the new mines operate cleaner.

## Experience of society

Then the topic is Finns' experience of society.

Political discussion arouses feelings of anger in many Finns.

A new study says that around 50 percent of Finns feel anger because of political debate.

The director of the research institute **Karina Jutila** believes that the reason is, for example, the government's savings and unemployment.

The political debate therefore arouses a feeling of hatred, but there are also things that bring a feeling of togetherness.

They are Finland's nature, language and independence.

## Swedish education for police officers

Then the subject is police training.

In Finland, the police must know not only Finnish but also Swedish.

Here we are studying Swedish at the Police College in Tampere.

Teacher **Ritva Lyytinen** says that she has to start teaching Swedish almost from the beginning.

In Lyytinen's opinion, there is too little Swedish teaching in primary and secondary schools these days.

In Finland, the police have to know Swedish so that the police can also deal with Swedish-speaking Finns.

Students also think it is important.

(**Tuomo Vuorinen**, police student)

*- You shouldn't get caught up in not being able to handle things in another official language\...(trying to speak Swedish)\...lazy?*

## Wednesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is cloudy and there will be rain both in the south and in the north.

In the evening, the weather will improve from the west.
