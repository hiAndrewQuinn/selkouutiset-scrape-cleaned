Economy and housing trade. Foreign nurses. Civil service. Weather

## Finance and housing market

First, economic news.

More and more Finns think that buying a home is a financial risk.

A survey by S-bank shows that a third of Finns already share this opinion.

Confidence in the economy is weak, which is why the prices of used, or old, homes have fallen.

Experts estimate that the reasons behind this are increased unemployment and uncertainty in global politics.

More and more people think that buying a home is a risk. Especially those under 35 are worried about finances.

## Need for community nurses

Then about the nursing field.

Community nurses are finding it harder to find work now than they did a couple of years ago. This is due to savings in the public sector. In addition, there is a shortage of money in welfare areas.

Some welfare areas no longer hire nurses from abroad. In South Ostrobothnia, a welfare area recruited 24 nurses from Vietnam a year ago.

Everyone stayed to live in the province and integrated well, says Anne Isoniemi:

*- We also started systematically offering them training, namely on this kind of multiculturalism and the use of plain language.*

*- The first time was a little difficult because I didn't understand, but little by little I understood and everything became easier. (Thom Vo)*

Community nurses are now finding jobs less often than before. Only a few welfare areas hire foreign nurses.

More nurses will be needed in the future.

## Civilian service and mental health problems

Finally, about civilian service.

A record number of people subject to compulsory military service will be released. This year, the number of people released is approximately 20 percent higher than last year.

Now, up to half of those performing civilian service will be exempted from service.

The underlying cause is most often mental health problems.

Civilian service is an alternative to military service in the Finnish Constitution.

Every year, approximately 8,000 young adults are exempted from national defense service, i.e. military or civilian service.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Wednesday, there will be plenty of cloud cover in Lapland and showers are possible.

Showers will also occur on the west coast.

The sun is still shining widely in the southern and central parts of the country. The temperature is about 10 degrees.
