Strikes. Icebreakers. Ice swimming. Travel fair. Weather.

## Strikes

First, the strike news.

The workers' unions have decided to organize strikes.

The strikes will take place at the beginning of February. They last 2 days.

For example, 60,000 employees who belong to the Confederation of Industry will go on strike.

Strikes stop work in many companies. There are strikes in more than 700 workplaces.

The unions will organize strikes in early February.

Strikes are political. The trade unions are angry with the government because the government intends to weaken social security and workers' rights.

## Icebreakers

Then the news about the icebreakers.

The work of the icebreakers has started early this winter.

This is where the icebreaker Urho goes to sea.

Because of the severe frosts, the sea froze earlier than usual.

That's why ships already need the help of icebreakers. Icebreakers open a route for other ships.

The work of the icebreakers started early.

There are 8 icebreakers in Finland. 7 of them are already breaking ice in the Finnish sea area.

## Ice swimming

Then about open swimming.

Open swimming is a popular pastime.

Researchers say that open swimming is healthy.

Open swimming reduces stress and pain and prevents flu.

## Travel fair

Let me tell you that there is a Travel Fair in Helsinki this weekend.

In the middle of a cold and snowy winter, Finns dream of a holiday in the warmth of the south.

Finns like to travel to Spain, for example, which is now a partner of Matkamessu.

However, the most Finns travel to the neighboring countries of Sweden and Estonia.

Tomorrow the sun will shine almost all over the country. There may also be small cloudy areas in the south and west.

The day is cold, the frost is 10-25 degrees in the southern and central parts of the country and 20-40 degrees in the north.
