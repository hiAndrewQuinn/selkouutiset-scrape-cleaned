President Sauli Niinistö has commented on the events of Finland's eastern border. Niinistö says that Russia's goals have not been successful.

Russia brought asylum seekers to the Finnish border because it wanted to disturb Finland. Niinistö says that the harassment was not successful. For example, the Finns did not start arguing about how to act in the situation.

Due to interference from Russia, Finland decided to close the eastern border. The land border between Finland and Russia cannot be crossed at the moment.

### Dubai Climate Summit

Finland supports a fund that helps poor countries in the fight against climate change. Finland gives 3 million euros to the fund.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told about it on Saturday in Dubai. Orpo is participating in the UN climate conference in Dubai.

The new fund was established at the climate conference on Friday. With the help of the fund, poor countries are helped to survive, for example, bad floods and storms. Floods and storms are increasing due to climate change.

### Data breach of a transport company

New information has been received about the data breach of the transport company Westlog. Criminals took information about Westlog's customers in August.

Now it is reported that the criminals got the personal data of more than 116,000 Finns. However, the information has not been published anywhere.

Westlog delivers to customers, for example, Tena products, which are used in the treatment of urinary incontinence.

### Train traffic

There have been delays in train traffic on Saturday. There have been delays in Tampere, where northern trains have been 5-20 minutes late.

The reason for the delays was the locomotive of the freight train, which derailed on Thursday evening. Lifting a large and heavy locomotive back onto the tracks is difficult and slow. That's why the work has taken a long time.

However, the incident did not affect train traffic very badly.

### Snowfalls in Munich

There has been heavy snowfall in Europe on Saturday. Snowfalls have also hindered trains and air traffic.

For example, all flights at Munich Airport in Germany were canceled on Saturday due to snow. Munich Airport is the second largest airport in Germany.

The cancellations also affected flights between Munich and Helsinki.
