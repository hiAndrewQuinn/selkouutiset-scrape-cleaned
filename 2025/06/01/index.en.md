Protected plants and animals have received new prices.

A protected species is a species of living organism that is protected by law. Not all species may be picked or caught.

Many endangered species have been protected. Endangered species are in danger of extinction.

If someone picks or destroys an endangered plant, they may be prosecuted.

The police will first investigate the matter. If charges are filed and the perpetrator is convicted, he or she will have to pay the value of the item and fines.

The police are currently investigating an incident in which forestry machinery drove over the Hukkajoki River in Suomussalmi. The river was filled with many endangered species of otters.

## The Arctic fox is Finland's most valuable mammal

The arctic fox is the most expensive mammal in Finland. A mammal is an animal that gives birth to live young and is fed milk by its mother.

The value of a polar bear used to be 7,400 euros and now it is almost 18,000 euros.

The price of freshwater pearl mussels, or raw mussels, also rose significantly. Before, the value of raw mussels was around 600 euros, but now it is around 1,500 euros.

Many colonies of brute animals no longer reproduce.

The spotted eagle is the most valuable bird. Its price is almost 13,000 euros.

The value of some species also decreased. For example, the value of the white-tailed eagle decreased because there are more of them now than before.
