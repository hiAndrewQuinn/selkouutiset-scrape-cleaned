Euro elections are held once every five years.

In the European elections, the Parliament of the European Union, i.e. the EU, is elected, which has 750 representatives from different European countries. There are 15 Finns in the EU Parliament.

More than 350 million people can vote in the European elections.

The EU Parliament has a lot of power when the EU makes laws. Those laws affect all of our lives a lot.

## The most popular parties

The European elections are close.

Yle's poll shows that in Finland the coalition is the most popular party in the European elections. The coalition says that the EU must be stronger in the economy.

The coalition thinks that if the EU is not strong in the economy, it is not strong in security.

The 2nd most popular party in the European elections is SDP. SDP believes that there are parties in Europe that oppose democracy. SDP intends to act against these parties.

The 3rd most popular party in the European elections are the basic Finns. Basic Finns like the EU less than other big parties.

Kokoumus, SDP and Perusfinomaks all want the EU to help Ukraine, which was attacked by Russia two years ago.

## Far right

There are four weeks until the European elections.

Surveys in Europe show that in many European countries, far-right parties may get more seats in the EU parliament.

Far-right parties do not like the European Union. They also think that immigration is not a good thing.

Many far-right parties do not want to help Ukraine, which was attacked by Russia in 2022.

Yle's European election machine is now open. In the Euro election machine, you can see who is the best candidate for you in the European elections.

## Repeat

This time the topic of the News Week has been the European elections. Let's repeat the most important things.

The European elections are in a month.

The European Parliament has a lot of power over our lives.
