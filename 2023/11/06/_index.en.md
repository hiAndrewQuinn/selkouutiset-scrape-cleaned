Many dogs have gotten sick from dog food. The dogs got sick maybe because they ate Musti ja Mirri dog food.

Musti ja Mirri says that many hundreds of dog food buyers have contacted the company. The company has stopped the sale of more than 30,000 kilos of dog food.

The authorities are investigating the matter.

Fewer children are born in Finland than before. This is what the Institute of Health and Welfare says.

In 2022, approximately 45,000 children will be born in Finland. It is 9 percent less than in 2021.

On Monday, the day of Swedishness was celebrated. On Swedishness Day, the Swedish language is celebrated in Finland.

Almost 300,000 Finns speak Swedish as their mother tongue. Many famous Finns have been Swedish-speaking, for example Marshal Mannerheim and writer Tove Jansson.

Swedish Day has been celebrated in Finland for more than 100 years, since 1908. The day of Swedishness, or Svenska dagen, is always November 6.

Everyone can practice Swedish with, for example, Yle's clear news in Swedish. They can be found in Areena under the name Yle Nyheter på lät svenska.
