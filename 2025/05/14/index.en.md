## Finland dropped in Unicef's comparison

First, about children in Finland.

Children and young people are doing worse than before.

Finland's ranking plummeted in a comparison regarding the well-being of children in rich countries.

In the 2020 UNICEF comparison, Finland was 5th - now 17th. UNICEF is the United Nations Children's Fund.

The result was worsened by suicides among young people in particular. Children's overweight and educational outcomes are also problems.

The best countries in terms of child well-being are the Netherlands, Denmark and France. Finland fell to 17th place in the comparison.

The worst are Turkey and Chile.

## Immigration policy has tightened

Then about immigration.

The Finnish government has tightened its immigration policy over the past two years. The changes are exceptionally large.

For example, fewer asylum places are being granted and family reunification is more difficult. People are being turned back from Finland more quickly than before.

Reception allowances will be reduced, and there will be restrictions on home care allowance for immigrants.

The government has tightened its immigration policy.

It is not yet known how this will affect immigration. For example, fewer people will come to Finland for work because the economic situation is poor.

There will also be fewer asylum applications.
