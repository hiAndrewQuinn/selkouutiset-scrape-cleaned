Party support. School starts. Level crossing accidents. Weather.

## Yle party support survey

First, domestic politics.

Yle's poll shows that the National Coalition Party's popularity has fallen the most.

The Prime Minister's party lost almost 2 percentage points. The National Coalition Party's support is now 19.1 percent.

The largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), continues to lead with 24.7 percent support.

The opposition center party rose the most, with support now at 15.1 percent.

The support of the governing Finns Party is 12.3 percent.

The center has gained supporters from the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party.

## Schools start

Then about the start of school.

Most schools start the semester this week.

There are still large differences between class sizes. For example, there is a school in Oulu with 1,000 students and a school in Ylitornio with 6 students.

The teaching profession says that a class of more than 25 students is too large.

51,000 students are now starting first grade.

What is new is that the law bans cell phones during school lessons.

Many municipalities take a strict line on cell phone bans. In some, phones are not even allowed to be used during recess.

## Level crossing accidents

Then about train traffic.

In the past week, 3 people have died in a collision between a train and a car at a level crossing.

In Siilinj√§rvi on Sunday, a van driver and passenger, as well as 2 dogs, died. In Turku on Monday, a car driver and a train driver were injured. On Tuesday, a van driver died in Loimaa.

There are still several hundred dangerous level crossings in Finland.

There are about 50 particularly dangerous intersections. For example, they lack a barrier or traffic lights, or it is difficult to see the direction of the approaching train at the intersection.

3 people have died at level crossings this week.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow is a normal summer day. The sun is shining all over the country, but it rains occasionally.

In the south, it rains a little more and there may be lightning, meaning thunderstorms are possible.
