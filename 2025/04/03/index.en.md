## Trump imposed heavy import tariffs

First, about the global economy.

US President Donald Trump has announced new import tariffs. An import tariff is a tax on goods imported from abroad.

There will be a 20 percent tariff on European products and a 34 percent tariff on Chinese products, for example.

Trump says tariffs will bring more jobs and factories to the U.S. Many economists disagree.

The consequence of tariffs could be a global trade war.

US President Donald Trump has announced new import tariffs.

The Finnish Institute for Economic Research Etla estimates that the tariffs will harm Finland and the rest of the European Union. US exports accounted for 11 percent of Finland's total exports last year.

## Electrical cable from Sweden

Now about energy.

A major electricity transmission project from northern Sweden to Finland is almost complete.

The electricity transmission lines of the Finnish and Swedish transmission grid companies have been connected at Ylitornio in Sweden. The aim is to equalize and lower the price of electricity in Finland.

Hydro and wind electricity in northern Sweden is the cheapest in Europe.

The transmission connection will be put into operation in December.

## Schjerfbeck exhibition in New York

Now art news.

An exhibition by Finnish artist Helene Schjerfbeck will open in New York in December.

Schjerfbeck was one of the most famous Finnish artists.

This is the first time a Finnish artist has an exhibition at the prestigious The Met Museum.

The exhibition will feature approximately 60 works by Schjerfbeck. Helene Schjerfbeck lived from 1862 to 1946.

The Met will feature, among other things, the beloved work The Convalescent.

## Spring heat record

Yesterday was the warmest day of spring so far.

Statistics show that it has never been this warm on the second day of April.

The warmest temperature was at the Kumpula observation station in Helsinki, 19.1 degrees.

The exceptionally warm spring weather encouraged people to go outside.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is getting colder.

In the south it is below 10 degrees. In the north it is a bit frosty and it can snow sometimes.

The wind is strong at the beginning of the day. The wind makes the weather feel even colder.
