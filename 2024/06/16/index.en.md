The Finnish design house Marimekko was founded in 1951. Marimekko was founded by Armi Ratia.

In post-war Finland, a product family was born that was connected to an entire way of life.

Marimekko was fashion, textiles, clothes and color. The patterns could be seen in homes and on the streets.

Marimekko was also seen abroad. For example, the president's spouse Jaqcueline Kennedy fell in love with the 1960s Marimekko designs and bought 9 Marimekkos at once.

Marimekko has had more than 3,500 patterns throughout its history. The most famous is the 60-year-old Unikko, and almost every Finn also recognizes stripes and checks.

Marimekko Unikko was born by chance. The founder of Marimekko, Armi Ratia, by no means wanted flowers in the collections. Ratia wanted Marimekko to stand out from the rest of fashion.

However, textile designer Maija Isola decided to draw flowers and presented the images to Ratia in 1964.

Ratia fell in love with a model called Unikko.

## Poppy everywhere

The poppy pattern has been used, for example, on the side of an airplane, on a phone cover, fabrics and walking sticks, as well as dishes.

Unikko didn't get into clothes until the turn of the 21st century, and Unikko also stayed in clothes.

Aalto University professor Maarit Salolainen says that Unikko is part of the identity of every Finn.

## Armi Ratia

The director of the design museum, Marianne Aav, says that Armi Ratia's Marimekko is anti-fashion. Ratia wanted to make clothes that are not limited by the fashion of the day and that can be worn year after year.

Armi Ratia was a big celebrity in Finland. His influence was so great that he has been made into, for example, a film and an opera.
