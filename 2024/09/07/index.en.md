## Deficit 12 billion euros

The state receives approximately 77 billion euros in revenue. The state's expenditures are around 89 billion euros.

The budget deficit is more than 12 billion euros, which means that the state has to take on more debt of more than 12 billion euros.

The state collects money from taxes. Many things become more expensive because their value added tax is increased. These include, for example, medicines, sports services, entrance fees, hotels, taxis, buses and domestic flights. The value added tax on these will rise from 10 percent to 14 percent.

There will be a bigger increase for sweets. The VAT on sweets will rise from 14% to 25.5%.
