## Cleaning industry

First, news from the cleaning industry.

Cleaning companies are having a hard time. They could soon lose customers.

The reason is the changes the government is making to taxation. The household tax deduction will be reduced next year.

Cleaning costs will no longer reduce the customer's taxes as much as they do now, and therefore purchasing cleaning services will become more expensive.

Many cleaning companies are having a hard time.

Not all customers can afford to buy as many cleaning services as they can now.

## Member of Parliament Kiuru

MP **Krista Kiuru** was beaten on Friday.
