Changing the track gauge. Age limit for army reserves. Early potatoes. Weather.

Subtitles may be missing from the broadcast. The problem is being investigated.

## Finnish track gauge

First, the train tracks.

Finland plans to switch to the European gauge. This means narrowing the tracks.

Finnish railways now have the same track gauge as those in Russia and Eastern Europe.

Transport Minister Lulu Ranne says the reason for the change is security. The situation has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine 3 years ago.

The construction of new tracks is planned to start in Northern Finland. They will be built alongside the existing tracks.

Finland plans to switch to European gauge. This will facilitate traffic across the border west to Sweden.

Finland's security of supply will also improve. Security of supply means preparing for crises and disruptions.

The European Union also wants change and is providing money for it.

The government has allocated 20 million euros for the project. It will be used to design the so-called NATO track in Northern Finland.

Construction could possibly begin in the 2030s.

## Reserve age limit

The Ministry of Defense proposes that the upper age limit for military reserves be raised to 65 years.

Now the reserve age limit is 50 years for crew and 60 years for officers.

The change may affect those born in 1966 and after.

The aim is for special experts in particular to remain in the reserve longer. For example, civilian skills such as cyber skills, medical care and training are important.

The age limit for military reservists is set to be raised to 65. The number of reservists could then exceed one million.

The proposal is intended to be submitted to Parliament before the summer recess.

## Early potatoes

More spring news from the fields.

Early potato harvesting has begun in Rymättylä, Naantali, Western Finland. It is exceptionally early.

Although the weather has been cool for people, it has been suitable for early potatoes.

*- Historically early. Never before have potatoes been sold this early. The old record has been broken by almost 2 weeks now*.

## Weather

Finally, the weather forecast.

The sun will shine tomorrow.

However, there may also be some clouds in the sky in the afternoon.

The temperature is around 15 degrees Celsius almost throughout the country.
