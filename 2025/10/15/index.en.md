Debt brake. Redundancies. Cohabitation. Weather.

## Debt brake

First, the topic is the debt brake.

The parliamentary parties have agreed on a so-called debt brake.

The purpose of the debt brake is to reduce government debt. The debt brake is valid across election periods.

The parties commit to reducing the state debt, but the methods are always decided by the parties that form the government after the elections.

The other parliamentary parties approved the debt brake, but the Left Alliance remained out of the agreement.

The Left Alliance believes that tight regulation can even be bad for the economy.

## Redundancies

Then news from working life.

Almost 40 percent of Finns have considered quitting their current job.

Duunitori's survey shows that the most common reasons for resignation are disappointment with workplace management and work overload.

People who work in customer service are the most likely to plan a career change.

## Co-living for retirees

Then we'll talk about cohabitation.

The researcher believes that cohabitation among retirees will become more common in the future.

Shared living is of interest to seniors because trust in elder care has waned.

Not everyone has relatives nearby, so they have to look elsewhere for a support network, says Jari Pirhonen, a researcher at the University of Tampere.

People are interested in co-living.

In Turku, a group of friends from four families are preparing for old age by building a shared terraced house.

This is what Harri Arikka, a resident of the row house, said:

\- When we are at the point where our feet may no longer rise at the same pace as before, we will decide who goes to the store and who to the pharmacy, and who takes care of what matters, and we will certainly be able to continue to share our everyday lives.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

Colder air is flowing into Finland.

Tomorrow, Thursday, there will be showers in the south and east and in places also in the north.

However, most of the country is sunny.
