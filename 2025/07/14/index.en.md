## Air traffic agreement

First, news about the air traffic agreement.

The long-running labor dispute in air transport has been settled.

Employees and the employer agreed on working conditions over the weekend.

For example, they agree on salary increases.

Therefore, the new contract is only valid for 1 year and 6 months.

Due to a labor dispute, the airline Finnair canceled over 1,200 flights in the spring and summer. It affected the travel of 100,000 people.

Passengers at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport were pleased that the labor dispute was settled. Many feared that the strikes would continue and more flights would be canceled. Jaakko Alatyppö:

– This is a really good thing. We were flying in the spring, and we had to reschedule our flights. Now it's nice that we can. There's no fear that these flights will change.

The air traffic labor dispute was settled over the weekend.
