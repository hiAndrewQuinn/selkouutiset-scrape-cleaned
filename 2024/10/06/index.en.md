Tens of thousands of people have received a text message from the police warning them about scam calls. The police suspect that the criminals are going to call these people and try to swindle money from them.

The police's warning message says: \"You have an increased risk of receiving a scam call from criminals\".

The police message was received by people whose names were found on criminals' playlists. The police remind us that criminals can also call others.

The police say that they have obtained the criminals' playlists. The lists have names and phone numbers of tens of thousands of people. Some people's dates of birth are also written on the lists. The police do not yet know where the information came from.

Crime Commissioner Janne Kyllönen from the Eastern Finland Police says that it is a nationwide scam. Fraudsters call people and pretend to be a bank clerk, for example. They try to get a person to hand over online banking credentials or accept bank transfers to criminals.

Crime Commissioner Janne Kyllönen says that the swindlers are really skilled. They have already managed to cheat people out of millions of euros.

## Bank IDs should not be given

The police remind you that you should not give your bank details to anyone. Banks or authorities never ask for bank IDs.

However, if the bank and credit card information falls into the wrong hands, you must close the cards immediately and contact your bank. You should also report the crime to the police.
