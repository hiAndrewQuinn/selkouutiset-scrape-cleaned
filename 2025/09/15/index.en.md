Municipal tax. Driving test. European Basketball Championship. Weather forecast.

## Municipal tax

First, news about municipal taxes.

The difference in municipal taxes is increasing between different municipalities.

The lowest municipal tax is in Kauniainen and the highest is in Pomarkku.

The Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities says that in some municipalities the tax rate could even double by 2040.

The difference in municipal taxes is increasing between different municipalities.

The main reason is that the number of residents in many municipalities is rapidly decreasing. Therefore, the municipality's tax revenue is decreasing.

Municipalities must raise taxes so that daycare centers and schools can operate.

The greatest need to raise municipal taxes is in rural areas.

The situation is better in large cities.

## Driving test

Now for the news about the driving tests.

Driving test failures have increased significantly.

Last year, about 50 percent of driving tests were failed.

10 years ago the rejection rate was 30%.

Driving test failures have increased significantly.

The reason may be the change in the driving license law in 2018. The number of mandatory driving lessons at driving school was reduced, and the driving test was made more difficult than before.

**Marjo Immonen**, an expert at the Finnish Transport Agency Traficom, says that it is worth taking enough driving lessons, even though the mandatory amount is lower than before. The need is individual.

*"When there were 18 driving hours before, even that wasn't enough for everyone. So it's very individual how a person learns to drive."*

Finally, sports news.

Finland has placed fourth in the European Basketball Championship.

The Finnish men's national basketball team lost the bronze medal game to Greece on Sunday. The result was close. Finland lost by only 3 points.

Finland finished fourth in the European Basketball Championship.

The ranking is Finland's best ever.

Finnish team captain **Sasu Salin** says that the loss in the bronze medal game is disappointing, but the players are happy that the team made it this far.

*"It's sad, but I'm proud and happy about everything I've been able to do here."*
