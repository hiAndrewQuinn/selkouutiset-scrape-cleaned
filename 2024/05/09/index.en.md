## Olkiluoto nuclear power plant

First, news about the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant.

Maintenance work on the Olkiluoto reactors has been delayed.

Olkiluoto has 3 reactors. Now there are 2 reactors in service.

The maintenance work was supposed to be over by now, but the maintenance work will only be completed in the next few days.

White-fronted geese live in central Europe in the winter, and they often migrate north through Finland in the spring.

Then there can be a lot of them in the fields, up to 50,000 geese in one open field.

In the fields, white-cheeked geese cause damage to farmers.

That's why they are trying to expel them.

Even goose exterminators have been hired for the job. They walk in fields where geese are not wanted.

Birds can also be scared away with, for example, a hand laser like this.
