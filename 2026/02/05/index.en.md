## Party support

First, news about politics.

Yle has again asked Finns which party they support.

The most popular party is still the Social Democratic Party (SDP), supported by 25 percent of Finns.

Support for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has increased. The SDP is an opposition party, meaning it is not in the government.

The second most popular party is still the National Coalition Party.

The Coalition Party has almost 19 percent support. The Coalition Party is the governing party and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo is also from the Coalition Party.

The third most popular party is now the Centre Party, with 14 percent support.

The Centre Party rose to third place because the support of the Finns Party fell. The Centre Party is not in the government.

The fourth most popular party is now the Finns Party. The Finns Party has around 13 percent support. The Finns Party is in the government.

Yle's poll shows that the SDP's leading position has strengthened and that the Finns Party has fallen to fourth place in popularity.
