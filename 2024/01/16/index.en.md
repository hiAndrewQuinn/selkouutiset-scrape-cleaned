Purchasing power
---------

First, news about the economy.

The purchasing power of Finns has started to increase again.

The turnaround happened at the end of last year. The rise in prices started to slow down.

Wages went up last summer, but prices also went up a lot. Therefore, purchasing power decreased. Last year, purchasing power decreased by more than 6 percent. The effect is the same if a middle-income wage earner loses 2,000 euros.

*What is middle income.\
A middle-income Finn receives a salary of around 3,800 euros per month.*

The purchasing power of Finns has started to increase again.

The purchasing power of a middle-income person will increase by perhaps 750 euros this year.

It may take 4 years for the purchasing power to return to its previous level.

This is what economist **Hannu Nummiaro** says.

*"It's probably still 3-4 years before we're at the same level as before the beginning of this purchasing powerhouse."*

Eastern border
-------

Now news about the situation on the eastern border.

Finland is preparing for unauthorized crossings of the eastern border.

The Border Guard estimates that there are hundreds of people in Russia who are waiting for the border to open. They have come to Russia from, for example, the Middle East.

Last week, 15 people entered Finland illegally across land borders.

For example, these Syrian men came to Finland last week. They say that even thousands of migrants are waiting behind the border.

The Border Guard prepares for unauthorized crossings of the eastern border.

This is what deputy commander **Marko Saareks** says.

*"In any case, the number is so significant that we have to take it into account when planning and preparing for border security tasks."*

Public transport in Rome
---------------------

Finally, news from abroad.

Here we are in Rome, the capital of Italy. Public transport in Rome is the slowest in Europe. The waiting time for buses and trains is often 20 minutes.

Yle reporter **Jenna Vehviläinen** travels a distance of 4 kilometers. There are many passengers. There are only 2 metro lines. The third metro line has been long awaited. Romans say public transport sucks.

Public transport in Rome is the slowest in Europe. It took Jenna more than an hour to cover 4 kilometers. He took 2 subways and 1 bus.

Weather
---

Another weather forecast. The weather is cold. It is snowing a little in the west and north, otherwise it is quite sunny.

The temperature is between -15 and -30 degrees. It is milder on the west coast.
