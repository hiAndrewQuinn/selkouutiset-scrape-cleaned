Collective agreements. Changed Minister of Labor. Shop lunches. Weather.

## Collective agreements for municipalities and the state

First, labor market news.

A new collective agreement has been reached for the local government and welfare sector.

Salaries will be increased by about 7 percent over about 3 years. In addition, employees can receive more money from the industry's own salary program.

The agreement applies to approximately half a million employees, such as teachers, nurses and firefighters.

A new collective agreement has also been reached for state employees.

The salaries of state employees will increase by almost 8 percent over three years.

The agreement applies, for example, to government officials and police officers.

## New Minister of Labor

Then politics.

The government's Minister of Labor has changed.

Matias Marttinen of the National Coalition Party has taken office as the new Minister of Labour today. Marttinen is a second-term MP. He is 34 years old and hails from Rauma.

There are currently many unemployed people in Finland. However, the new Minister of Labor believes that things are changing for the better.

Matias Marttinen is the new Minister of Labour. Former Minister of Labour Arto Satonen returns as a Member of Parliament.

## Shop lunches

Then about the food.

More and more Finns are eating lunch at the grocery store. For example, here in Tampere, many people go to the S-Market in Kaukaj√§rvi for lunch.

Many people come here during their lunch hour at work. There are also many retired customers.

People say that the store's lunch counter is good because it provides quick, home-cooked food. Today, the menu includes mashed potatoes, meatballs, baked salmon, and cabbage rolls.

Many people think that lunch from a store's hot counter is cheaper than a restaurant lunch.

More and more Finns are eating lunch at the grocery store.

Anne Koivunen from Nokia explains why:

-- The selection is good, the service is friendly, this is fast.

## Wednesday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is chilly. Cold air is coming from the north.

It's quite cloudy, but the sun shines sometimes. It's drizzly, meaning it's not raining.
