Russia's war in Ukraine continues. On Friday, Russia attacked Ukraine with missiles and drones.

Russia fired missiles at many Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Ukrainians have been killed and injured in the attacks.

Russia's war in Ukraine has been going on for almost 2 years now. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

### Traffic safety

Safety in Finnish traffic has improved. This is what an association called Liikenneturva says.

Liikenneturva estimates that 170 people will die in traffic this year. That's 30 less than last year. In particular, traffic deaths of people a little over 20 years old have decreased.

Traffic safety has been improving for a long time. Even about 50 years ago, even more than 1,000 people died in traffic a year.

### World population

The world's population has grown this year as well.

At the end of the year, there are 75 million more people than at the beginning of the year. This is what the US Census Bureau estimates.

There are now more than 8 billion people in the world. The more precise figure is 8 billion 20 million.

The US Census Bureau estimates that 4 people are born every second in January.
