The topic of the news week is the meeting between the presidents of the USA and Russia.

US President **Donald Trump** and Russian President **Vladimir Putin** have met in Alaska.

The goal was to end the war in Ukraine, or at least a ceasefire.

However, the results of the meeting were limited.

We will now tell you more about the significance of the meeting between President Trump and President Putin and the reactions to it.

## Not new

Presidents Trump and Putin spoke in Alaska for about two and a half hours.

After the meeting, the presidents did not announce any specific decisions.

Trump praised Putin and said the meeting went well. However, the presidents did not share anything new with the press.

Many experts say the meeting was a victory for Putin because Putin did not make any concessions and he was able to avoid new sanctions.

## Trump's conversation with Zelensky

After the meeting, Trump spoke by phone with Ukrainian President **Volodymyr Zelensky** and European leaders.

Trump said that the goal is to get a direct peace agreement in the Ukraine war, not just a ceasefire.

Trump said he and Putin pretty much agree that a quick solution is needed in Ukraine.

## Europe

European news media estimated that Trump failed to achieve a ceasefire or concrete decisions at the meeting.

Many media outlets estimate that Europe will have difficult decisions to make about how to continue supporting Ukraine and how to approach Russia.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyi will travel to Washington on Monday to talk with Trump.

## Pros and cons of dating

The meeting between Trump and Putin may have reduced Trump's desire to impose new sanctions on Russia.

Putin's position was strengthened because he was able to meet the leader of another great power, the USA.

It is a good thing for Ukraine and Europe that Trump and Putin did not agree on Ukrainian issues beyond Europe and Ukraine.

The great fear of Ukraine and Europe was that the presidents might agree on territorial concessions. However, this did not happen.

It was also good that Trump did not promise to ease sanctions on Russia nor did he promise to return to old trade relations.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was the meeting between the US and Russian presidents in Alaska.

Presidents Trump and Putin discussed the war in Ukraine, but the results of the meeting were limited.

Trump did not achieve a ceasefire, but Putin's position was strengthened when he was able to have such a meeting.
