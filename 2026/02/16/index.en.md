Housing construction. Disability services. Olympic bronze. Weather.

## Housing construction

First, about housing construction.

A record low number of apartments are being built this year. Experts tell Yle that too many apartments are still being built.

There is already more housing than is needed in large cities. Even though the population is growing, the economic situation is poor and people live closer together than before.

Immigrants in particular live in close quarters.

Young people are moving out of home later, and students are living in shared apartments more than before.

There are a record few apartments being built, but there are still too many. In this building in Jätkäsaari, Helsinki, half of the apartments are still empty.

## Disability services

Then about disability services.

More and more customers are demanding corrections to decisions made by disability services. The reason is a deterioration or change in services.

A new law on disability services came into force last year.

Leena Reponen suffers from dystonia and migraines. She has had a personal assistant for many years.

Reponen applied for additional hours for the assistant because his functional capacity had deteriorated. The Pirkanmaa Welfare Region decided that the hours would be reduced and replaced with paid home services.

## Olympic bronze

Finally, Olympic sports.

Suvi Minkkinen has won bronze in the women's pursuit event in biathlon.

She is the first Finnish female biathlete to win a medal at the Olympics.

No Finnish biathlete has won an Olympic medal in 28 years.

Minkkinen was close to the silver medal because he shot without errors and did not receive penalty rounds. Minkkinen cleared all 4 shooting positions cleanly.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is blustery. In the south it is 4...10 degrees below zero. In the north it is colder.

In the central part of the country, the wind makes the air colder.
