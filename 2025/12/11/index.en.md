## Foster parents

Now news about foster parenting.

Foster children are sometimes transferred to a new placement too quickly.

For example, family caregivers are not always heard enough. This can happen when a child is urgently transferred to a new foster care placement.

Complaints about the transfers have been made to regional administrative agencies and have also been processed in administrative courts.

Foster children are sometimes transferred to a new placement too quickly.

The National Institute for Health and Welfare says that rapid transfers are made for the sake of the child.

The reason may be, for example, mistreatment of the child or exhaustion of the family caregiver.

If you are in a hurry, consulting a family nurse can be postponed. This is according to **Johanna Hedman**, Head of Development at THL.

*"If there is a situation where you need to act really quickly, it may not be possible at that moment."*
