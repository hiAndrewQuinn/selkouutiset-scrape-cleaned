Nutritional recommendations. International Plastics Meeting. Kittens. Weather.

## New nutritional recommendations

At first, the topic is the new nutritional recommendations.

The Food Agency has published new recommendations on a healthy diet.

The recommendations say that Finns should eat up to 800 grams of vegetables, berries and fruits per day. It is also good to eat whole grains and legumes.

Fish is also part of the recommended diet.

You should eat no more than 350 grams of red meat per week. Cold meats and sausages should be eaten as little as possible.

Finns have been given new recommendations for a healthy diet.

The recommendations say, for example, that the best drink for health is water.

## International plastics meeting

Then the topic is the international plastic meeting.

The UN countries are meeting this week in Busan, South Korea. The countries are trying to agree on reducing plastic production.

If nothing is done, plastic production will probably more than double by 2050. At the same time, the amount of plastic waste increases.

That is why the consumption and production of plastic must be reduced, says Finnish negotiator Tuulia Toikka.

Only 9 percent of the world's plastic is recycled. Most of the plastic ends up in landfills and in the environment. More than 5 million tons of plastic waste ends up in the world's oceans every year.

## Kitten shop

Finally, the topic is kittens.

There are big differences in the prices of domestic cats.

For example, on the Tori.fi website, the price of a regular domestic cat kitten is usually 300-600 euros.

Prices for long-haired cats and purebred cats are higher. More than 1,000 euros can be requested for them.

The sellers say that the kittens are in high demand.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be clear in Lapland, meaning there are no clouds in the sky. It's 10-25 degrees below zero.

Instead, it is mild, cloudy and gray in the southern and central parts of the country. It rains a little in places.
