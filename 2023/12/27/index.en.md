The financial situation of Finns has weakened during the year.

Kuluttajaliitto asked about people's financial situation in early autumn. About 25 percent of the respondents said that they are in financial distress or very close to it.

More than half of the respondents said that even a 100-euro change in expenses would drive them into trouble.

The previous survey was conducted a year ago, in the fall of 2022. At that time, 20 percent of the respondents were in financial distress or close to it.

### Electricity self-sufficiency

Finland is now electricity self-sufficient. It means that Finland now produces as much electricity itself as we consume in a year.

Self-sufficiency was reached, for example, because the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant started producing electricity last March. In addition, record amounts of electricity have been produced with wind power. Finns have also been more frugal in electricity consumption.

Next year, Finland can already produce more electricity than it consumes.

In recent years, electricity has been brought to Finland from Sweden and Russia. Up to 25 percent of the electricity has been imported electricity.

### Art museums

The art museums have had a lot of visitors this year.

For example, the number of visitors to the Ateneum Art Museum in Helsinki rose above half a million for the first time. The Albert Edelfelt exhibition was visited by so many people that it became Ateneum's most popular exhibition of all time.

Visitor records have also been broken by, for example, the Finnish Museum of Photographic Art and the Didrichsen Art Museum. Design Museum and Espoo Museum of Modern Art
