Schools regularly train for dangerous situations.

Students practice acting in various dangerous situations, for example in a school shooting.

The students practice, for example, how they can leave and go to shelter.

Spare doors have been built in schools so that students can escape more easily.

Pupils also learn to pile obstacles in front of the door if a violent person comes to school.
