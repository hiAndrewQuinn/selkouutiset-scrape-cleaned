## Economic growth

First, news about the economy.

The Finnish economy is growing more slowly than expected.

This is what the Ministry of Finance, or Ministry of Finance, estimates. It has lowered the forecast for the development of the Finnish economy.

VM predicts that the public sector deficit will be 3.7 percent this year. In the spring, the forecast was 3.5 percent. Public entities are municipalities, welfare regions and the state.

Borrowing is also increasing. Finland will take on more debt this year and in the following years than the Ministry of Finance estimated in the spring.

The Finnish economy is growing more slowly than expected.

A big reason is that interest rates are falling more slowly than expected.

When interest rates remain high, debt costs also remain high.
