There are more families in Finland who do not have enough food than before.

This is what a survey by the Save the Children organization says. The survey respondents were children and young people from different parts of Finland.

14 percent of children from poor families said that the family has a shortage of food. The figure is almost twice as large as last year.

In addition, many children have stopped the hobby because of the family's poor financial situation.

More than 100,000 Finnish children live in families with low incomes.

### Finns' prejudices

Many Finns prefer to do business with another Finn. This is what Yle's new survey says.

For example, about 25 percent of Finns want to see a doctor with a Finnish name.

Finns don't always trust a doctor's skills if the doctor has a foreign name.

More than 30 percent of Finnish landlords also want a tenant who is similar to themselves.

Many Finns therefore do not like to do business with people of foreign background.

According to experts, the prejudices of Finns hinder the integration of immigrants.

### Castle party

The castle's party will be held again on Finland's Independence Day, i.e. December 6.

President Sauli Niinist√∂ and Jenni Haukio are inviting around 1,700 guests to the Presidential Palace this year.

A large part of the guests will be invited to Linna's party for the first time. This year, however, the guests of honor are veterans who fought for Finland's independence during the Second World War.

The majority of Finns follow Linna's celebrations on television. Last year, almost 3 million Finns watched Linna's party.

### Snowfalls in Pirkanmaa
