The history of para sports, i.e. disabled sports, is connected to the Second World War. After the war, many people had some sort of disability. They wanted to organize sports competitions for people with physical disabilities.

The Paralympics were held for the first time in Rome in 1960. Today, the games are held every 2 years. The races take place alternately in summer and winter. The Paralympics are always held in the same city and in the same year as the Olympics.
