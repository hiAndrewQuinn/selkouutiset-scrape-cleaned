Housing trade. Ship waste water. Lucia. Saturday weather.

## Housing transaction

First, news about apartments.

The number of housing transactions has started to increase, according to the credit institution Hypo.

Hypo predicts that housing prices will also rise.

Housing prices will probably increase by about 3 percent next year.

The number of housing transactions has started to increase.

Lower interest rates are boosting housing sales.

The European Central Bank last lowered interest rates yesterday.

The decision will also affect mortgage interest rates in Finland.

## Ship waste water

Then the topic is ships.

Ships are no longer allowed to empty toilets into the sea off the Finnish coast.

Starting in July, all ships must empty their toilets into the sewer in port.

Passenger ships already do this, but most cargo ships empty their toilets directly into the sea.

Ville Wahlberg, CEO of the Baltic Sea Foundation, says that there are so many ships sailing in the Baltic Sea that they generate as much toilet waste as a medium-sized city.

Ships are no longer allowed to empty toilets into the sea off the Finnish coast.

Finland is the first country to ban all ships from discharging waste into the sea.

## Lucia

Then the topic is Lucia.

Lucia's Day is celebrated today.

Lucia brings joy to the dark winter. For example, she visits nursing homes.

Lucia also wishes the president a Merry Christmas.

This year's Lucia is Daniela Owusu. Owusu was chosen as Lucia by a newspaper vote.

Owusu wanted to show that anyone can become Lucia. Owusu's father is from Ghana, and Owusu's mother is from Finland.

Today is Lucia's Day.

Daniela Owusu will be crowned Lucia of Finland this evening at Helsinki Cathedral.

Then Owusu will receive a candle garland, like all Lucias before her.

After the coronation, the Lucia procession will take place in the center of Helsinki.

Lucia is important to Swedish-speaking Finns.

The custom of celebrating Lucia's Day came to Finland from Sweden.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow, the southern and central parts of the country will see a lot of snow and rain. Driving can be dangerous due to the snowfall.

It's really cold in the north and it's blustery, meaning it doesn't rain.
