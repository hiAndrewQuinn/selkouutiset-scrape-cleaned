## Weapons from the USA to Ukraine

First, news about US military aid to Ukraine.

US President Donald Trump promises that the United States will supply weapons to Ukraine.

The United States does not give away weapons for free. The military alliance NATO pays for the weapons.

Ukraine will at least receive Patriot missile systems from the United States. Ukraine will use missiles to repel Russian attacks.

President Trump said yesterday that he does not like the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

According to Trump, Putin talks nicely, but then he bombs everyone.

Trump also threatened Russia with heavy tariffs if the war in Ukraine does not end soon.

The United States promises to provide military aid to Ukraine.

## Unemployment is getting longer

Next news about unemployment.

It is more difficult for the unemployed to find work. The job search now takes an average of 1.5 years.

Sonja Gustafsson has been looking for work for over a year. She has applied for around 200 jobs.

Gustafsson has not been able to find work, even though he is highly educated and has also worked abroad.

It is now more difficult for the unemployed to find work.

## Eastern Finland wants tourists

Finally, some news about tourism.

Eastern Finland wants more foreign tourists.

Many tourism companies in Eastern Finland are in difficulty because Russian tourists are no longer coming to the region.

Tourists are now being attracted from Central Europe, but it is difficult. For example, a German tour operator cancelled charter flights to Savonlinna because so few trips were sold.

Many companies have been forced to close their operations, says Visit Finland Project Manager Susanna Markkola:

– Businesses are already struggling. We've even seen some closures and we're going pretty thin.

Eastern Finland wants more foreign tourists.

## The weather is sunny.

Still a weather forecast.

The sun will shine on Wednesday.

It may rain a little in Central Finland. Elsewhere it will not rain.

The temperature is 20–30 degrees.
