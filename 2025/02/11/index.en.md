The number of homeless people has started to rise.\
Most homeless people spend the night temporarily with relatives and acquaintances.

Many also spend the night outside, in stairwells or in emergency shelters, or on housing emergency duty.

## Nokia's new CEO

Then news from the business world.

Finnish telecommunications company Nokia has a new CEO. He is American Justin Hotard.

Nokia has been led by Pekka Lundmark for 5 years. The new CEO will start at the beginning of April.

Nokia is seeking new growth from data centers, or computer rooms. Until now, growth has been sought from telephone networks, or telecom operators.

Artificial intelligence requires a lot of power, which is why many data centers are being built all over the world.

Nokia's new CEO Justin Hotard will start work in early April. Hotard says Nokia is also looking for growth in the defense sector.

## Ecological compensation

Finally, about the disadvantages of construction.

Compensation for environmental damage caused by construction begins. Vantaa is the first Finnish city to implement ecological compensation.

The disadvantages of construction are therefore compensated for by caring for nature elsewhere.

The trees in this forest are being cut down because a building for the Finnish Immigration Service is planned on the site.

The environmental damage will be compensated for a couple of kilometers away in Sotungi, where the forest is being restored.

Restoration involves returning the environment to its natural state or as close to it as possible.

## Weather

The weather is getting colder.

The sun is shining in the north, but it's freezing.

It is cloudy in the south and the temperature is on both sides of zero degrees.

The next day it will be cold in the south too.
