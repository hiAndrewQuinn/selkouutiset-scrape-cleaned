Finnish economy. Art schools. Neil Hardwick. Weather.

## OP's economic forecast

The first topic is the Finnish economy.

OP Bank's assessment of Finnish economic growth is darker than before.

The bank now estimates that the Finnish economy will grow by 1 percent this year. Back in January, OP Bank estimated that the Finnish economy would grow by 1.7 percent.

OP Bank's assessment of Finnish economic growth is darker than before. The reason, in the bank's opinion, is that new customs duties on international trade are bad for the Finnish economy.

## Art schools

Now the topic is art schools.

It is more difficult to study fine arts in Finland than before. There are fewer study places than before.

There is a private art school in the Helsinki Cable Factory. The school is called the Free Art School. The Free Art School was founded in the 1930s.

Elina Merenmies, principal of the Free Art School:

\-*We are taught the practices of painting very thoroughly. It's something that isn't done much anymore.*

It is more difficult to study fine arts in Finland than it used to be. In the early 2010s, fine arts were taught at 7 universities of applied sciences. Now, you can study to become a fine artist at only 5 universities of applied sciences.

## Neil Hardwick

The topic of the next news item is a memoir.

Neil Hardwick has written a book. In the book, Hardwick looks back on life in Finland and England. Harwick is a screenwriter and director. He was born in England, but has lived in Finland for a long time.

Neil Hardwick has made, for example, the TV series Tankki põheen and Pakanamaan Karta.

Neil Hardwick has written a book. He says that good humor often has sadness in it:

\-*Tankki põhteen was written with Jussi Tuominen, which is specifically in the minor key. Every episode fails somewhere. The whole mood is very minor. That's why the reaction in Finland was that yes, this is very Finnish. That's how it is.*

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is blustery. The sun is shining in the central parts of the country. There are clouds in the sky in the south. The temperature is between +10 and +18 degrees. It is cooler in Northern Lapland.
