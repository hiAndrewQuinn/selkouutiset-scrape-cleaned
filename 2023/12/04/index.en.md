Russia intended to interfere with Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance NATO. This is what the secret Russian intelligence report, which Yle's MOT department has received, says.

The goal of the Russian intelligence service was to increase differences between Turkey and European countries and NATO. The security police knew about Russia's plans. Russia probably did not implement the plans in Finland.

Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership in May 2022. Finland is now a NATO member. Sweden is still waiting for Turkey to accept Sweden's membership in NATO.

### Independence Day demonstrations

The police are preparing for the possibility of clashes at the Independence Day demonstrations.

The police have banned the organization of the Helsinki without Nazis demonstration at Töölöntor in Helsinki. The reason is that the nationalistic 612 torch procession also gathers at Töölöntor. The organizers of the Helsinki without Nazis protest say that they will not obey the police ban.

Finland's Independence Day is the day after tomorrow, Wednesday.

### Kalevi Jänti's award

### Sea ice

Sea ice is still weak in a large part of Finland. That's why it's not worth going on the ice yet. The sea ice is now thick only north of Oulu.

There is already ice in many places by the sea, but the ice is weak. Therefore, moving on ice is not safe.

### Weather

The weather is cloudy. It's snowing a little in some places. Sometimes it snows a lot on the coast.

The temperature is between -5 and -15 degrees. In some places it is maybe even 25 degrees below zero.
