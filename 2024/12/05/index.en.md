Party support. Independence Day. The unknown soldier. Weather.

## Party support

First, news about politics.

The support of the parties is almost unchanged in Yle's new measurement.

The opposition party SDP is the most popular. 24 percent of Finns support it.

The second most popular is the prime minister's party Kokoomus. Its support is more than 18 percent.

The Basic Finns come in third and the Center Party in fourth.

## Independence Day

Then the topic is Independence Day.

Tomorrow, Friday, is Finland's birthday, i.e. Independence Day. Finland turns 107 years old.

The day is traditionally celebrated.

In the morning, the Finnish flag will be raised to the flagpole on Helsinki's Tähtitorninmäki.

Wreaths are placed on the hero's graves at the Hietaniemi cemetery.

The parade of the defense forces, or the army, will be held in Lappeenranta this year.

Students organize torchlight processions in different cities.

In the evening, there is the President's Independence Day reception, i.e. the Castle party. 1700 guests have been invited to the party.

Finns watch the festivities on TV.

They are especially interested in the party dresses of the guests.

Demonstrations are also organized in Helsinki. The police have been notified of at least three demonstrations.

## Unknown soldier

Then literature.

A reading marathon starts today at Yle Areena, where the book The Unknown Soldier is read through.

The book was written by Väinö Linna, and it was published 70 years ago.

The book tells about the continuation war that took place between Finland and the Soviet Union.

The Unknown Soldier is a work that every Finn knows. Many have read it or seen it as a movie.

It has also had a big impact on Finns' national identity.

The reading of the book starts at Areena at 5 p.m. There are about 70 readers.

The first reader is President Sauli Niinistö.

## Friday weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is cloudy and it is snowing a little in places.

On the coast, the temperature is around zero, otherwise it's a few degrees below zero.
