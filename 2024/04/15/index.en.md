## Iran's attack on Israel

First, news from abroad.

Iran's attack on Israel increases tension in the Middle East.

Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel on Saturday evening.

However, almost all missiles and drones were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. That is why there was little destruction in Israel.

Iran's air attack on Israel is revenge.

On Easter, Israel attacked the Iranian consulate in Syria. Israel then killed 7 members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

That's why Iran attacked Israel now.

Iran's attack on Israel increases tension in the Middle East. For example, Israel can respond to an attack by Iran.
