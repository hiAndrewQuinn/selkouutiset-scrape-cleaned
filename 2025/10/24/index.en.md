## Sanctions on Russia

First, news from abroad.

The US and the EU have decided on new measures against Russia.

The US imposed sanctions on Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft. States or other companies are not allowed to cooperate with Lukoil and Rosneft.

The EU stipulates that liquefied natural gas may not be imported from Russia to other countries.

The US and EU are imposing sanctions on Russia because Russia continues its war of aggression in Ukraine.

## Highway 9

Now the topic is the highway.

Highway 9 is in poor condition. Highway 9 is the busiest road in Finland with 2 lanes. There are many accidents on the road.

The road between Tampere and Orivesi in Pirkanmaa is in poor condition. People think there are too few overtaking spaces on the road. The asphalt on the road is in poor condition in some places.

Highway 9 has been in poor condition for a long time, but the road's rehabilitation has not started. The Ministry of Finance proposed money for the road's rehabilitation in September. The government still did not provide money for the road's rehabilitation.

Highway 9 is in poor condition. The road runs from Turku to Tohmajärvi in North Karelia.
