## Helsinki data breach

First, the topic of data breach.

Information has been stolen from the city of Helsinki.

The data breach was carried out in the systems of education and training.

The perpetrator took, for example, the personal IDs of students and guardians.

The data breach affects up to 120,000 people.

The police are investigating.

The City of Helsinki's systems have therefore been breached.

The author got access to the data because the city's server was not updated in time.

Experts warn that similar data breaches can also happen in other cities if data security is not properly taken care of.

Some patients may experience severe symptoms, for example in the muscles.
