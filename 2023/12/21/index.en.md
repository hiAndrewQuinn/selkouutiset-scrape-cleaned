The majority of Finns think that Finland's NATO membership is a good thing. Finland became a member of NATO last April.

A new poll shows that more than 80 percent of Finns support Finland's NATO membership. Only about 10 percent of Finns do not like that Finland belongs to NATO.

Finns who have a good education and a good salary trust NATO the most.

Finland decided to join NATO after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The defense alliance NATO takes care of the security of the member countries. In addition to Finland, NATO has 30 other member countries. NATO includes the USA, Canada and most European countries.

A volcanic eruption in Iceland has released sulfur into the air. Iceland's sky is red because of sulphur.

Sulfur clouds also travel from Iceland towards other countries. Sulfur clouds were already over Norway on Wednesday.

At the weekend, sulfur clouds will come to Finland. However, there is so little sulfur in the air that it does not pose a danger.

Iceland's volcanic eruption began on Monday.

The streets are now slippery. Many streets are covered in ice.

In addition, it has snowed on the ice. Pedestrians fall easily because they don't notice slippery places under the snow.

Hospital emergency rooms have been crowded on Thursday. For example, in Helsinki's Meilahti, there were more than 20 patients with slips during 2 hours in the morning.
