Building fires. Spanish train crash. Health tests. Weather.

## Building fires

First, about fires.

There are many building fires in Finland that can be prevented by good construction.

Yle's MOT editorial team found that there have been almost 300 such fires this decade.

**Minna** from Tampere lost almost everything in a fire in her apartment building in 2022. Only photographs and a sewing machine remained.

The investigation revealed that the building's fire compartmentation system failed quickly, which is why the fire quickly spread to the entire attic.

Fire compartmentation must confine fire and smoke to a specific part of the building.

Deficiencies in fire compartments are common. Previously, separate fire compartments for apartments were not mandatory.

Good construction prevents the spread of fire. Only a matchbox-sized hole in the fire compartment can cause a fire to spread to a neighbor.

## Spanish train accident

News about a train accident.

In Spain, authorities are continuing to investigate Sunday's train crash.

At least 40 people have died when the last 2 carriages of a bullet train derailed.

A bullet train collided with an oncoming train near the city of Cordoba. The train was traveling from Malaga to Madrid.

More than a hundred people were injured.

Spanish Transport Minister **Oscar Puente** said the accident was strange. It happened on a straight stretch that was renovated last May.

However, the train drivers' union has told the train companies that the section of track was in poor condition.

## Home Health Tests

Now health news.

There are many health tests for sale in stores.

Yle tested the values of vitamin D, total cholesterol and the body's iron stores, or ferritin, with a home test. The same values were measured in a laboratory.

The home tests were not as accurate as the lab tests, but the results were in the right direction.

**Heli Kuusipalo**, a leading expert at the National Institute for Health and Welfare, says that you should not rely solely on home tests.

The total cholesterol test is particularly problematic. It doesn't tell you how much good cholesterol you have and how much bad cholesterol you have.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is breezy but mostly cloudy.

The weather will get colder as the week progresses.

Temperatures are below freezing all the way to southern Finland.
