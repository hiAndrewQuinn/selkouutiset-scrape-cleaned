Parliament has voted on a vote of confidence in the government this week.

The government received the confidence of Parliament in the interim vote and can continue.

A question-and-answer session is a way for the opposition to gauge the government's confidence. The confidence of a minister can also be measured with a question-and-answer session.

The interim question was raised by the opposition parties Center and Movement Now. The parties said that the government's savings jeopardize good care for the elderly.

The government received a vote of confidence from Parliament by 100-74 and is therefore allowed to continue. 25 MPs were absent.

In the vote, all MPs from the opposition parties voted no confidence in the government. Opposition parties are parties that are not part of the government.

The government now includes the National Coalition Party, the Finns Party, the Christian Democrats and the Finnish People's Party.

## Making an intermediate question

At least 20 MPs are required to submit a supplementary question.

The government must respond to Parliament within 15 days. After that, Parliament will hold a debate on the matter in the chamber.

After the debate, Parliament will vote on the government's confidence.\
In the history of the Republic of Finland, only 4 governments have had to resign due to an internal issue.

The first time this happened was in 1926. The last time a government fell in a by-election was in 1958.

## There are a lot of intermediate questions

The opposition asks many questions every year.

They allow parties to raise issues for discussion, which then also provides citizens with information about the parties' policies.

One goal of the interlocutory question is to get the government to change its proposals.
