Immigrants. Åland. Starry sky. Weather.

## Immigrants

First, news about immigration.

Educated immigrants like Finland less than before. This is what a new survey says.

The survey was answered by more than 1,000 immigrants who live in Finland. They work in the technology sector, for example in game companies.

Half of them say that they would not recommend Finland to other immigrants who have attended university.

90 percent say that they are concerned about the Finnish debate regarding immigration.

Educated immigrants like Finland less than before.

The reason is that there has been a lot of negative discussion about immigration in Finland. The government wants to tighten Finland's immigration policy in many ways.

## Åland
