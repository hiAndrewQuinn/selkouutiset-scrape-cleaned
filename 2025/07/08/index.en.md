## Families of foreign students

First, about foreign students.

There are an increasing number of families of foreign students in Finland.

Last year, there were almost 12,000 applications from family members. A couple of years ago, the number was around 1,300.

The change is due to the fact that students can now more easily obtain a residence permit for the entire duration of their studies.

Most students come from South and Southeast Asia.

Growth has also brought problems. Many foreign students do not have enough money to live in Finland.

There are an increasing number of families of foreign students in Finland.

Interior Minister Mari Rantanen wants to tighten the entry of family members. The previous government made entry easier.

## Cell phones can be turned into money

Then about electronics.

They want to exchange old electronics for money.

Textile company Finlayson is the first company to introduce the new payment method.

For example, you can buy home textiles with the value of an old mobile phone.

Actually, electronics are not brought to the store's checkout, but are exchanged online.

For example, an old iPhone 11 is worth 111 euros. You can get a couple of duvet covers for it, for example.

Finlayson says it wants to lead the way in responsibility.

They want to exchange old electronics for cash. The plan is to expand the payment method to other online stores.

## There are more bears in Central Finland than before

Finally, bear news.

In Central Finland, bears have been seen near houses more than ever before. There are 5 times more sightings than 5 years ago.

The bear's hunting area now also expanded to Central Finland and South Savo.

Bears are particularly abundant in Kannonkoski, with over 200 bears spotted there this year.

Bears cause damage to farms. For example, bears break the plastic of bales, which causes the feed to spoil.

In Central Finland, more bears have been seen near houses than before.

Two bear felling permits are planned for Kannonkoski.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be dry throughout the country, meaning it will not rain.
