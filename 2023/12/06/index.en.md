The most popular event on Independence Day is the President's Independence Day reception, or the Castle Party. President Sauli Niinistö and Mrs. Jenni Haukio have invited 1,700 guests to Linna's party.

President Niinistö and Mrs. Haukio will host Linna's party for the last time this year. Next year, a new president will be elected in Finland.

The castle party is a very popular party. About 3 million Finns usually watch the castle celebrations on TV or![Areena](https://areena.yle.fi/1-66979953).

The Russian military threat worries many Finns. The E2 research institute has asked Finns if Russia worries them. Almost half of Finns say that the Russian threat worries them.

Finns over 50 are most worried about the Russian threat. Russia worries young people less than old people. About 30 percent of Finns under the age of 25 are worried about the Russian military threat.

For many young people, independence has grown in importance because the world situation has become uncertain.
