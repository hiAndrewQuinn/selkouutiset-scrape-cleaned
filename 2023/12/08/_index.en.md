Train traffic will stop next Thursday, i.e. December 14th. Then the trains don't run all day.

The reason is the strike. Many trade unions start a strike, i.e. they stop work on the night between Wednesday and Thursday. The strike lasts 24 hours.

Unions organize strikes because they are angry with the government. The government plans to make changes to the status of employees and social security.

For example, the government intends to reduce the money that the state spends on housing allowance. In addition, the government plans that the employee will no longer be paid for the first day of sick leave.

### Putin

Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to continue in the job of president.

Work in car repair shops is changing. The reason is that electric cars are becoming more common.

Repairing electric cars requires a new kind of know-how. A car mechanic must also know a lot about electricity and batteries.

In addition, a car mechanic must know information technology, which is a lot in an electric car.

Car mechanics often need further training in order to keep up with the development of the industry.

The training of new car mechanics has also changed because of electric cars.

### Drowned

7 people drowned in Finland in November. 2 of them sank in the ice. This is what the Finnish Swimming Teaching and Lifesaving Association says.

The association reminds that the ice is still weak. It is not safe to move on the ice this early in the winter.

From the beginning of January to the end of November, a total of 82 people have drowned in Finland.
