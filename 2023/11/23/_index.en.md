Finland is closing more border crossing points on the eastern border. The reason is the migrants that Russia sends to the Finnish border.

Border stations Vartius, Kuusamo and Salla will be closed today, Thursday. Only one border crossing, Raja-Jooseppi, remains open. Raja-Jooseppi is the northernmost border station. Already last weekend, Finland closed the border crossings of Southeast Finland.

Finland hopes that the arrival of migrants will stop when there is only one open border station, which is in the far north.

Finland is establishing processing centers for migrants who come to Finland from the eastern border. This is what Interior Minister **Mari Rantanen** says.

The identity of the migrants and the reason why they have come to Finland are found out in the processing centers. Migrants must stay in the organizing centers until they are registered. The purpose is that the authorities can monitor migrants.

Interior Minister Rantanen says that migrant centers are needed because Finland does not know who the new arrivals are. The Ministry of the Interior is preparing a regulation on organizing centers.
