Unemployment. Medical bills. Art exhibition. Weather.

## Unemployment

First, the topic of unemployment.

There are a lot of people in Finland now who don't have a job. They are unemployed.

In January, there were over 325,000 unemployed people. That is much more than a year ago.

One reason why there are so many unemployed people is the poor situation in construction. Very few new houses are being built in Finland.

Construction provides a lot of work for people in various professions.

When construction ends, jobs will disappear.

There are many unemployed people in Finland now.

However, researchers say the situation may soon be better.

There are already small good signs in the Finnish economy.

## Medical fees

Then the topic is health.

It costs more to see a doctor than it used to. Medical fees increased at the beginning of this year.

In public healthcare, a specialist costs almost 70 euros.

Rising fees are a problem for people with little money.

Medical fees rose at the beginning of the year.

Researchers say that many poor people may no longer have money to see a doctor.

For example, pensioners, single parents and the unemployed may be in trouble.

They may not visit a doctor even though their health is poor.

## Art exhibition

Then the topic is art.

There is a really interesting art exhibition at the Tampere Art Museum.

It introduces an art movement called surrealism.

Surrealism was a major trend in art in the early 20th century.

It made works of art about different aspects of the human mind and the subconscious.

The Tampere Art Museum has an art exhibition on surrealism.

Surrealism's subjects included, for example, people's dreams and sexual desires.

The exhibition at the Tampere Art Museum features works by really famous artists.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Thursday, there may be some rain in the southern and central parts of the country.

The sun may shine in Lapland. The temperature is around 0 degrees.
