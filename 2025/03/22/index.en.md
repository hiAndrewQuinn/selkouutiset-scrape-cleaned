Military drones

## Military drones

The topic of the week in the news is military drones.

The importance of drones in warfare has grown rapidly. This has been seen in the war in Ukraine.

Military drones are also being developed in Finland. They could become an important export product for Finland.

Now let's talk more about military drones.

## Versatile drone

Drones are aircraft that are controlled by remote control.

A drone resembles a small helicopter. Drones have many propellers that lift the drone into the air.

The drone can take off from anywhere and land anywhere. The drone is also quiet.

A drone may have a camera that transmits images. Drones are used for reconnaissance and surveillance, for example.

A drone can also carry explosives, meaning it can be used to carry out military strikes.

Ukrainian drones have flown over 1,000 kilometers to Moscow and struck Russian oil refineries.

## Finnish defense equipment company Patria

The demand for drones is rapidly increasing in the armies of many countries.

Many companies have begun developing drones because their demand is growing rapidly all over the world.

Finnish defense equipment company Patria is also developing drones.

Patria has also presented drones at international fairs.

Patria's Product Development Director **Pekka Ruutu** says that drones have great potential.

Finland could perhaps manufacture a lot of drones and sell them abroad. This could have a big impact on Finnish exports.

Finland has good conditions for developing drones. If a drone works in the Finnish winter, it will work everywhere else.

## Patria's growth

Defense equipment company Patria has increased its ability to develop drones.

Last year, Patria acquired the Finnish drone company *Nordic Drones*.

Patria employs approximately 3,600 people. The number of Patria employees increased by approximately 300 people last year.

This year, Patria's number of employees will also increase by approximately 300 people.

Drones are new to Patria. Patria also manufactures a lot of other defense equipment, such as armored vehicles.

## A new type of military tool

The war in Ukraine has highlighted the potential of drones. Drones have changed a lot about warfare.

Drones are much cheaper than many other weapons.

Drones can be used to monitor areas and drones can be used to attack.

Losses are small because the drones are controlled remotely.

## Repetition

The topic of the week in the news was military drones.

Let's recap the most important points. Drones have become an important military tool.

Many countries are now looking to acquire drones. Drone sales are growing rapidly.

Finland also knows how to develop drones. They could perhaps become an important export product for Finland.

This was a news week in plain Finnish. See you again, let's hear from you!
