Adult skills survey

Finland has been celebrating the results of an adult skills survey this week. The survey shows that Finnish adults' literacy and numeracy skills are top-notch.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## Finland tops the skills comparison

Finland has performed well in a new international adult skills survey. The survey compares adult skills in OECD member countries. The comparison includes 31 countries.

The study shows that Finnish adults have the best literacy and numeracy skills among OECD countries. Around 70 percent of Finns have at least a good level of literacy and numeracy skills.

Japan ranks second in the comparison in literacy and numeracy skills, and Sweden ranks third.

Finns also performed well in problem-solving skills, with Finland tied for first place with Japan.

## Literacy skills gaps

The skills survey shows that Finland still has room for improvement in one area.

There is a big gap in literacy between first-generation immigrants and the native population. The gap is larger in Finland than in other comparison countries.

However, the literacy gap decreases if the immigrant's home language is Finnish or Swedish. The gap also decreases if the immigrant has lived in Finland for a long time.

However, the literacy skills of immigrants have improved since the previous measurement.

## Adult education works well

The last time the adult skills survey was conducted was 10 years ago. Finland also performed well then, but now the results are even better.

Finland's success shows that adult education works well in Finland, says OECD Director for Labour and Social Affairs Stefano Scarpetta.

Finns can develop their own knowledge, knowledge and skills even in adulthood. Learning can continue even after a person is already in working life, says Scarpetta.

## Repetition
