Technical skills. Fitness course for the army. Losers in the Arena. Weather.

## Technical expertise

First, about technical training.

The popularity of craft subjects has plummeted in comprehensive schools. The reason for this is that the teaching of technical work and textile work was combined in 2016.

Experts say that school provides poor skills for vocational studies in technical fields.

Teachers say that the students' skill level has dropped a lot.

Vice-Rector **Juha Salonen**:

\- If the student is not familiar with using a tape measure or a cordless drill.

Researcher **Manne Kallio** from the University of Helsinki is concerned about whether Finns will be able to build high technology anymore. He takes the icebreakers that Finland is starting to build for the USA as an example.

## Fitness course for the army

Then about the fitness of the young.

The municipality of Nurmijärvi in Uusimaa is organizing a fitness course for young people for the first time. It is free and voluntary.

The goal is to lower the threshold for entering military service. The course provides support and promotes fitness and mental well-being.

Conscription may be prevented if a young person has mental health problems or substance abuse.

Many young people may be worried about whether they will be fit enough to serve in the army. **Miika Tapaninaho**'s goal is to enter the RUK, or reserve officer school, in the army.

Only about 7 percent of all those who join the military are selected for it.

The Nurmijärvi municipality fitness course will last until next summer.

## TV series Losers

Finally, cultural news.

The TV series Luuserit is already a phenomenon on Yle Areena. The series has particularly reached young viewers.

The actors say that the series is full of humor, but it also has a more serious side.

The actors have a message especially for young men, says **Vanonit Muyau**.

\- Turning 20 is a really confusing time compared to being a teenager, when all the responsibility is on you.

The TV series Losers has reached young people. Season 4 was released this month.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be rainy tomorrow. Rain is water.

Only in parts of Lapland does it rain sleet or snow.

In Lapland, the temperature is close to zero. In the south, it is over 5 degrees warmer.
