720 representatives are elected to the European Parliament. The media have asked people in different countries which party they intend to vote for.

Many people plan to vote for candidates from conservative parties or far-right parties. The position of these parties is strengthened in the European Parliament.

## The meaning of far-right

The far right refers to many parties from the center right to the far right. The parties are different, but they have in common a negative attitude towards immigration and nationalism. Far-right parties do not want much power for the EU.

Now, half of the members of the European Parliament, or MEPs, are from the left or liberals. The biggest group is the coalition, or EPP. The coalition, liberals and social democrats have cooperated.

Polls show that in the future the right wing will be the majority in the European Parliament. If the far-right grows, other parties also need to cooperate more with the far-right. That is why the importance of the far right is increasing.

## Immigration policy and environmental policy

The growth of the far right can affect many things in the European Parliament. For example, climate issues may receive less attention than before.

Right-wing parties can also succeed in different countries' own elections. It also increases the importance and power of the far right in the EU.
