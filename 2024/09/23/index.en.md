## Economy

First the economic news.

The economy is turning for the better in Finland. This is the assessment of the Ministry of Finance.

The Ministry of Finance predicts that the economy will start growing from next year.

Finnish companies are starting to do better because interest rates are falling.

The rise in prices is also slowing down, and people are starting to buy more.

The Ministry of Finance estimates that the economy will take a turn for the better.

That's good news for the unemployed. Next year, unemployment will start to decrease.

## Blue-green algae as raw material

Then the topic is blue-green algae.

The plan is to turn blue-green algae into an industrial raw material.

Blue-green algae is collected here.

Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, pollute waters.

However, blue-green algae contains a substance that protects against solar radiation.

This substance is intended to be used, for example, in sunscreens.

Blue-green algae is therefore intended to be used as a raw material for industry.

This way we get a raw material that does not harm nature like many chemicals, says director Heikki Heiskanen.

In addition, collecting blue-green algae cleans the water.

## Sauna

Then the topic is sauna.

Here is Kotiharju's public sauna in Helsinki.

An important guest, Hiroshi Ota from Japan, visited the sauna.

Sauna is a popular pastime in Japan.

It is said that Hiroshi Ota is the sauna king of Japan. He is now taking a sauna for the first time in Finland.

Hiroshi Ota praised the power of the Finnish stove.

Tampere has the most public saunas in Finland.

That's why Tampere is the sauna capital of the world, and Tampere's saunas are also visited by many tourists.

## News in Arabic and Somali

Yle's Arabic and Somali news will start today, Monday.
