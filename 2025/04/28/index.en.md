Vaccinations. Pope. The coming of spring. Weather.

## Vaccination coverage

Initially, the topic was childhood vaccinations.

In Finland, vaccination coverage of children is decreasing, according to the National Institute for Health and Welfare.

Across the country, approximately 2 percent of children under the age of 3 have not received any vaccinations.

The situation is particularly bad in Central Ostrobothnia, where the proportion of children under 3 years old who have not been vaccinated is highest.

As vaccination coverage decreases, the risk of epidemics increases.

Some parents want to leave their children without vaccinations.

There are several reasons for this. For example, parents may be afraid of the side effects of vaccinations.

## The Pope's last journey

Then there's the matter of the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope.

Thousands of people have visited the tomb of Pope Francis in Rome. There were long lines at the tomb over the weekend.

Pope Francis died a week ago on Easter Monday. He was buried on Saturday.

200,000 people attended the funeral mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, including a large number of world leaders.

The Vatican is currently in mourning. The election of a new pope may begin next week.

## Spring is coming

Finally, news about the arrival of spring.

In southern Finland, nature has awakened to bloom early.

For example, in the Turku region, large meadows of white anemone are already in bloom. White anemone usually doesn't bloom until Mother's Day in May.

In southern Finland, plants have woken up early. This is because there is no more snow on the ground. The dark soil warms up quickly.

Head gardener Simo Laine shows how chives have grown to the point where they are ready to be eaten.

The rhubarb is also already so big that it will soon be possible to bake a pie from it.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather is getting colder. A cold wind will blow tomorrow.

It is still warm in the south. It rains a little in the south.

The sun is shining in the north, but the temperature is low.
