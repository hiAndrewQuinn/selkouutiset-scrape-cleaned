Used cars. Austrian elections. European multilingualism. Tuesday's weather.

## Used cars

First, used cars as a topic.

The used car trade is growing.

Disputes between car dealers and buyers have also increased.

One reason is that the buyer of a used car does not always get to know what repairs have been made to the car.

Here's an example: Marko Santanen bought a used car in Germany. Only after the sale did he find out that the car had been repaired due to an accident.

Such situations are common these days, says Autoliito CEO Pasi Nieminen.

Nieminen says that nowadays many people buy a car online. The buyer may not even see the car until it is brought to their home.

The used car trade is growing.

## Austrian elections

Then news from Europe.

The extreme right has won the elections in Austria.

The country's largest party is now the far-right Freedom Party. The Freedom Party opposes immigration.

The leader of the Freedom Party is Herbert Kickl. He doesn't like Jews and Muslims.

So the extreme right has won the elections in Austria.

Government negotiations in Austria will be difficult because other parties do not want to cooperate with the extreme right.

## European multilingualism

Then the topic is multilingualism.

The European Union wants to promote multilingualism.

The EU wants all EU citizens to know 2 other languages in addition to their mother tongue.

Professor Reetta Toivonen says that multilingualism is part of being European.

The EU wants to promote multilingualism.

However, multilingualism is not a good thing for all politicians.

For example, many far-right politicians think that only one language is needed in one country.

Professor Toivonen says that politicians have a great responsibility.

Speakers of minority languages may not dare to speak their own language in public places if politicians oppose multilingualism.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast. The week starts sunny. On Tuesday, there will be showers in the north, but most of the country will be cloudy.
