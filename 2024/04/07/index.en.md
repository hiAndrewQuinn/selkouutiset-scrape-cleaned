Defense alliance NATO turned 75 years old on Thursday. The party was celebrated at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen was also present.

Finland has been a member of NATO for a year now. Finland and Sweden are NATO's newest member countries. There are 32 member countries in NATO.

NATO member countries defend each other. If someone attacks one NATO country, other NATO countries will come to the rescue.

Because of this principle, Finland and Sweden decided to join NATO. They wanted to improve their own security, after Russia started a war against Ukraine.

## Finland's security

What is the security of NATO country Finland based on?

Finland has its own strong army. Finland also wants to take good care of the combat fitness of the army. For example, Finland has bought state-of-the-art military aircraft from the USA. They will come into use in the next few years.

NATO country Finland's security is, however, also based on the support of other NATO countries. This is a new thing. Previously, Finland could not be sure if it would get help if it was attacked.

Finland has also signed an agreement on defense cooperation with the USA. Based on the agreement, the USA can store weapons in Finland and train here.

## Finland and Ukraine

NATO country Finland supports Ukraine. The matter also became clear this week, when President Alexander Stubb visited Ukraine.

During the visit, the presidents of Finland and Ukraine signed a security agreement. In the agreement, Finland promises to supply weapons to Ukraine for many more years. In addition, Finland promises to help Ukraine when Ukraine wants to join NATO.
