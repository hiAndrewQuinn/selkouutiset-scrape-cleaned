## Shoplifting

Then the subject of shoplifting.

Shoplifting has increased.

Customers steal from stores more than before.

Customers try to take, for example, alcoholic beverages and expensive meats past the cash register.

Customers can also deliberately weigh e.g. fruit and loose candies incorrectly.

Self-service checkouts can also be misused. Therefore, in many stores they are only open if they can be monitored.

Shoplifting has increased.

They cause costs of one billion euros every year.

That's why shoplifting increases prices, which means we all contribute to paying the bill.
