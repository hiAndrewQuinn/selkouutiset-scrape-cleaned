## The presidential candidates' discussion about the eastern border

First, news about politics.

The presidential candidates participated in Yle's election debate yesterday. This was Yle's last election debate before the 1st round of the presidential election.

The candidates discussed, for example, the situation on the eastern border. Most of the candidates said that unauthorized border crossers should be able to be turned back to Russia. The action is called push back. The candidates said that this can be done if the law is changed.

The Coalition's **Alexader Stubb** reminded that people can be turned away from the border in Norway.

*Push back is, for example, legal in Norway. We have the problem at the moment that it is not yet legal in the European Union, but with Russia, unfortunately, we have to fight hard.*

Many candidates said Russia exploits migrants. That is why the EU law needs to be changed.

*That is why we should actively work together with other EU countries to change this legislation.*
