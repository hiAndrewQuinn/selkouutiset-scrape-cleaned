US protests. Summer work vouchers. Helsinki Biennale. Weather.

## USA protests

First, foreign news.

Protests are spreading in the US.

Protests began last week in Los Angeles.

A state of emergency has now been declared in the city. In addition, it is forbidden to go outside at night in the city center.

Protests have also spread to cities such as New York and Chicago. The National Guard has also been deployed to the streets in Texas to maintain order.

Protests are spreading in the USA.

Protesters are protesting against police raids to arrest migrants.

## Summer work vouchers

Then back home. The topic is summer work vouchers.

Even thousands of summer work vouchers will go unused.

The purpose of the voucher is to make it easier for young people to get summer jobs.

A summer work voucher is usually issued by the municipality. The voucher compensates the employer for part of the young worker's salary.

Even thousands of banknotes will go unused because there are fewer summer jobs available than before.

For example, in Helsinki and Lahti, only around 30 percent of summer work vouchers have been used in recent years.

## Helsinki Biennial

Then culture.

The major art event, the Helsinki Biennale, has opened in Helsinki.

The artworks can be seen at the Helsinki Art Museum, Esplanade Park and Vallisaari on the outskirts of Helsinki.

The exhibition features works by nearly 40 artists or groups of artists from Finland and around the world.

The works include sound works, media and textile art, and sculptures, all united by a nature theme and ecological values.

For example, this insect nest by Dzamil Kamanger and Kalle Hammi features lake reed, twigs and pine cones. The work is also a home for insects.

The Helsinki Biennale continues until September.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather in the south is cloudy and rainy in many places.

It will be drier in the north, but showers may also occur in Lapland.
