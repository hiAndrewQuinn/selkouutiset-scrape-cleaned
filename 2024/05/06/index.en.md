TNT explosive factory. Inflation. Garden plants. Forecast.

## TNT Explosive Factory

First, news from home.

Finland wants to build a TNT explosive factory in Finland.

TNT is an important explosive in ammunition.

Because of the war in Ukraine, TNT is being used up a lot now.

There is only one (1) TNT explosive factory in the EU. It's in Poland. The production of the Polish factory is not enough because there is a lot of demand.

Finland wants another TNT factory to be built in the EU region.

Defense Minister **Antti Häkkänen** says that Finland has discussed the issue with other countries.

It suits Finland that the TNT factory is built in Finland.

Finland has invested in ammunition companies. In March, Finland received over 30 million euros in EU funding for ammunition production.

## Rate of price increase

Now news about the economy.

Inflation, i.e. the rise in consumer prices, has remained calm in Finland.

The reason is Finland's weak economic development and falling energy prices.

Prices rise more slowly in Finland than in other euro countries. Only in Lithuania have prices risen faster than in Finland.

Inflation, i.e. the rise in consumer prices, has remained calm in Finland.

During the year, prices in Finland have risen by only 0.6 percent.

However, interest rates have not decreased because inflation is still high in other euro countries.

For Finns, the EU's monetary policy is tight. High interest rates increase mortgage costs, for example.

Finns' loan interest rates will only decrease after the inflation of all euro countries decreases.

## Garden plants and cold weather

Finally, about planting.

The cold weather worries home gardeners.

Many Finns have already planted flowers in their yards.

The weather is getting colder this week. At night, it can be frosty on the ground.

Wild plants are used to Finnish spring. That's why they usually withstand the cold.

The cold weather worries home gardeners.

Garden plants can be sensitive to the cold.

Gardener **Seppo Närhi** advises that it is not a good idea to plant plants in the yard this week.

Yard plants can be protected with gauze, for example. Flower boxes and balcony flowers can be taken inside if it's cold at night.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

On Tuesday, the weather will be cool and mostly cloudy. There will be snow showers in the east and north.

The temperature is between 3 and 10 degrees, in the north it is colder in places.
