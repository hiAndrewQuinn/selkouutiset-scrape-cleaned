Rentals. Wolt. Catastrophic damages. Weather forecast.

## Housing allowance and rents

First, news about housing subsidies.

The cut in housing benefit has increased rents for studio apartments.

Student housing allowance decreased significantly in August.

The decrease in housing benefit has been over 40 percent.

That's why many students are now looking for cheaper housing.

As the demand for small apartments has increased, their rental prices have started to rise.

In some cities, rents for small apartments fell for a while. Now the decline has stopped or turned into an increase.

The cut in housing benefit has increased rents for studio apartments.

The situation is problematic because students' ability to pay has decreased.

The option is to live with another student or move back home, says student Riina Rautio.

*"Then either living with a roommate. Or, well, cells aren't that popular, but that's one option. Or if there's a chance to move back home."*

## Food parcels

Now the news about food parcels.

Food delivery company Wolt is starting to hire delivery workers.

The change is significant. Until now, Wolt food delivery people have only been entrepreneurs.

The employment relationship between food delivery workers has been a long-standing issue.

The Supreme Administrative Court ruled in the spring that food delivery workers are employees, meaning they are not entrepreneurs.

Wolt did not like the decision. It is seeking an annulment of the decision.

Food delivery company Wolt is starting to hire delivery workers.

Wolt will initially hire 100 people.

Salary is paid according to the gigs.

The employees' union PAM says that this is not a good basis for salary because a person does not know in advance how much they will be paid for a working day.

## Bear damage

Finally, some news about agriculture.

Bear damage is increasing in agriculture.

Here we examine a broken hay bale on a farm in Lieksa. The bales were broken by a bear.

Farmer **Raimo Harjunen** says that hay spoils when the bale is broken.

Bear damage is increasing in agriculture.

For example, on this farm, bears have already broken 80 bales of hay this year.

The state pays hundreds of thousands of euros in compensation to farms every year.

This farm is also experimenting with repellent.

## Thursday's weather
