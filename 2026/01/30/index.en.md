Nursing home death. Food aid. Moomin reading marathon. Weather forecast.

## Nursing home death

First, news about a nursing home for the elderly.

A serious error has occurred at a nursing home in Espoo.

The resident died because the alarm did not go off.

The resident tried to call for help with the safety bracelet 11 times in an hour.

The alarm did not reach the scene because the nurses' phones were not on.

There are two emergency phones. Both phones had run out of battery.

No one had charged their phones.

A resident died at the Attendo nursing home in Espoo over the weekend because the alarms did not go off.

Attendo management says the staff has made a serious mistake.

The police begin investigating the case.

The Espoo case is the second nursing home death in a short period of time.

An elderly person strangled to death in a Turku nursing home in December.

## Food aid

Now the news about food aid.

The need for food aid is growing in Finland.

The reason is social security cuts.

Here, food aid is being distributed in Kemi.

There are over 1,200 names on the bread queue list in Kemi. That's a lot, considering that less than 30,000 people live in Kemi and the surrounding municipalities.

The need for food aid is increasing in Finland.

Every day more people come to seek food aid.

However, aid organizations receive less food from shops and industry than before.

The number of aid bags has also decreased in Kemi.

This is what volunteer **Helena Lahdenperä** says.

*When we first started, we gave 120 bags to customers. Now we have 80-90 \[bags\]. You can see the reduction in food.*

## Moomin reading marathon

Finally, news about the Moomins and Yle.

Yle is organizing a Moomin reading marathon this weekend.

Celebrities will read Moomin books aloud at Yle Areena and on the Yle Teema TV channel.

During the weekend, we will read all nine of Tove Jansson's long Moomin books.

There are 130 readers involved. They include writers, actors, and YouTubers.

President **Alexander Stubb** is also involved.

The reading marathon starts today, Friday, at 6 pm.

## Saturday weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will be cold on Saturday. There will be a lot of frost throughout the country.

The sun is shining in many places. There may be a little snow in Western Lapland.
