Finland and NATO support for Ukraine. Swimming schools. Hiroshima 80 years. Weather.

## Finland and NATO support for Ukraine

First, about support for Ukraine.

Finland will not participate in the joint support for Ukraine's weapons at this stage. The support is based on NATO's new financial instrument.

Sweden, Denmark and Norway buy weapons from the US for a total of hundreds of millions of euros. Now the Netherlands is joining in.

Finland will not participate in new NATO funding at this stage, says Minister of Defence Antti Häkkänen:

*- We are now committing our resources to this domestic industrial program, where we order products for Ukraine from our companies all over Finland.*

## Urban swimming schools

Then about swimming skills.

Many cities have organized free swimming lessons on the beaches.

The Finnish Swimming Instruction and Lifesaving Association says that fewer and fewer children know how to swim.

One problem is reaching the children who need swimming lessons the most.

In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, free swimming lessons have been available at several beaches.

Lilja Kokki encourages other children to join swimming school:

*- Swimming is fun, and you don't have to be afraid of it.*

## Hiroshima Anniversary

Finally, military history.

Today marks 80 years since the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

The nuclear explosion killed about 140,000 people. The city center was razed to the ground.

Hiroshima was a port and garrison city of 350,000 people 80 years ago. When the US dropped a nuclear bomb on it, Kunihiko Sakuma was 9 months old.

Sakuma is the chairman of Nihon Hidankyo, an organization representing victims of the atomic and hydrogen bombs in Japan.

The organization has received the Nobel Peace Prize.

Today marks 80 years since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

There are still about 50,000 people alive who survived the bombing of Hiroshima. Many have many illnesses and have experienced discrimination.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

The weather will be changeable on Thursday.

There may be some rain and thunderstorms in the east and north. It will be drier in the west.

The temperature is 16 - 22 degrees.
