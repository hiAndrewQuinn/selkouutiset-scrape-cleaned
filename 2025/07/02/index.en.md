## Student housing allowance

First, news about student housing.

Student housing allowance will change in August.

In the future, almost all students will receive a housing supplement for their student financial aid. Previously, students were paid general housing allowance.

The change means that support for many students will decrease. Support could decrease by up to hundreds of euros.

Students only receive housing allowance for the months they are studying.

Student housing allowance will change in August.

You must apply for housing allowance from Kela. You can get it if you live in a rented or right-of-occupancy apartment.

## Nature and the highway

Then there's the matter of road construction.

Highway improvements are destroying protected nature in Central Finland.

An important linden forest will be left under the new sections of Highway 4 in Vaajakoski, Jyväskylä. The area is also home to flying squirrels, bats and common frogs.

There is a rare exemption for road construction. Permits are usually not granted if the construction destroys important natural areas.

Now the permit was granted because there is much more traffic on the road than before.
