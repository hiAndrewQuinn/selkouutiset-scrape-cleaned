Iran warning. Health center fees. Length of day. Weather.

## Iran's warning

First, a matter from the Middle East.

Iran says the Middle East war could escalate.

Iran warns US of serious consequences after weekend attacks.

The US attacked 3 nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend.

Many fear that Iran may retaliate against the US attacks. Iran may attack US military targets, ships and aircraft.

Iran could also close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane in the Persian Gulf through which much oil and gas is transported.

Iran says Middle East war could escalate due to US strikes.

The US supports Israel with strikes. The US and Israel want Iran to be unable to build a nuclear weapon.

## Health center fees

Then the news about health center fees.

The health center fee may increase every year in the future.

The government wants to change the index that affects the amount of the payment.

The new index is updated once a year. This means that the health center fee may also increase every year.

The government wants the change to happen in 2027.

The health center fee may increase every year in the future.

The expert says that the increasingly expensive fee is bad for pensioners and the unemployed.

## Length of day

Finally, about the length of the day.

The amount of daylight hours is getting shorter again.

Saturday marked the summer solstice, when the northern hemisphere of the Earth turns toward the sun.

Saturday was the longest day of the year in Finland. There was more daylight than on any other day of the year.

In northern Finland, the sun did not set at all.

After the summer solstice, the days start to get shorter again.

Already in August, the evenings are dark again.

## Tuesday weather

Still a weather forecast.

Low pressure keeps the weather unstable.

On Tuesday, it will rain in many places in the southern and central parts of the country.

There will also be showers in the north.
