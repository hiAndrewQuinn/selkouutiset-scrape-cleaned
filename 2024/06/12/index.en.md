## Protection of forests

First, news about forest protection.

The government has decided what kind of old forests Finland will start protecting.

Ministers Kai Mykk√§nen and Sari Essayah told about the government's decisions yesterday.

For example, the government has decided that an old forest can be protected if it is at least 100 years old.

Also, for example, the tree species in the forest affect whether the forest can be protected.

The government has therefore decided on the protection of old forests.

The government praises the conservation decisions, but the opposition disagrees. In the opinion of the opposition, there are too many forests outside of protection.

## New scabies medicine

Then the medicine news.

Pharmacies will soon start selling a new scabies medicine.
