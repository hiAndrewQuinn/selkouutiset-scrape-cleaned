Economic. Hospitals. Helping Ukraine. Saturday's weather.

## Economy

First, the topic is the economy.

The American company Google might build a computer center in Finland. The center has Google technology.

The government said on Thursday that the value of Google's computer center is over one billion euros.

Google buys two large plots of land for the center.

The other plot is in Muhos and the other plot is in Kajaani.

The Google company plans to build a large computer center in Finland.

For Muho and Kajaani, Google's plan is really good news.

The center can bring jobs and a lot of money.

## Hospitals

Then the subject of hospitals.

Helsinki and Uusimaa lay off hospital employees.

The work of 280 people in the hospitals of Helsinki and Uusimaa will end.

The reason is that the hospitals have run out of money.

Helsinki and Uusimaa are laying off a lot of hospital employees.

People may therefore receive less treatment in the hospital in the future than before.

## Helping Ukraine

Then the topic is helping Ukraine.

Finns want to help Ukraine.

Russia's war in Ukraine has been going on for almost 3 years. This winter can be very difficult for Ukrainians.

Russia has attacked Ukraine's energy facilities. That's why Ukrainians can run out of electricity and heat during the winter frosts.

Finns want to help Ukrainians.

**Vieno Viitakare** was a child when there was a war in Finland. Viitakaree's father lost his leg in the war because it froze in the cold.

Now Viitakare's organization Vieno kammari knits woolen socks and baby clothes for Ukrainians.

This is where heavier help is collected. Machines and SUVs are going to Ukraine.

## Saturday's weather

Another weather forecast.

The weather is different in the south and in the north.

It is cloudy and warm in the south. There are plus degrees on the thermometer.

There are no clouds in the north. It's freezing in the north.
