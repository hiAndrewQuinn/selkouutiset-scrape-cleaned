Finnish weapons

Finland plans to spend a lot more money on its military.

The reason is that Europe's security is worse than before.

Russia is dangerous. It invaded Ukraine. The US may no longer protect Europe.

That's why Finland spends more money on security.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## 3 billion euros per year

The Finnish government plans to spend more money on the military in the coming years. The amount is an additional 3 billion euros each year.

Finland is buying more tanks, cannons and military equipment, for example.

It is difficult for the Finnish economy to spend much more money on the military.

Finland's expenses are already greater than its income.

In addition, there are more and more elderly people in Finland with poor health.

That means Finland has to spend a lot of money on hospitals.

It is a difficult question how Finland will have enough money for everything.

## Anti-personnel mines

So Finland is putting more money into the army. In addition, Finland is starting to use anti-personnel mines again.

Landmines are weapons that are buried in the ground. When a person steps on a landmine, it explodes.

Many countries have abandoned anti-personnel mines. Finland also abandoned anti-personnel mines in 2011.

The reason is that many ordinary people have died from anti-personnel mines around the world.

Landmines are a big problem in many poor countries where there has been war.

## Why?

Why is Finland putting more money into the military?

The reason is that Europe's security is worse than before.

The security situation changed when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russia showed that it was ready for war.

At the same time, the US no longer protects Europe as it used to.

That's why the army must have effective weapons.

## Repetition

This time the topic of the news week was Finnish weapons.

Let's repeat the most important things.

Finland is putting more money into the army.

The reason is that Russia is a threat to Eastern Europe.

The US, on the other hand, no longer protects Europe as it used to.

The big question is how much money Finland has.

That's all for today. See you again, bye.
