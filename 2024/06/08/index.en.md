The early summer has been hot. The long hot spell ended only on Friday of this week.

Before that, there were a total of 22 hot days in May and June. On every hot day, temperatures above 25 degrees were measured somewhere in Finland.

There were 16 hot days in May. Never before have so many hot days been measured in May. So summer started really early this year.

## Back winter

If summer came quickly, spring came slowly this year. In April, the weather was already a little warmer, but then winter came back.

On April 23, Finns woke up to snowfall. Almost 30 centimeters of snow fell in some places. The snowfall caused, for example, accidents in traffic.

Last winter was also cold. In snowy Finland, it was about 10 degrees colder than usual at the end of April.

Even after May Day, at the beginning of May, snow and sleet fell in different parts of Finland. Soon after, the heat started. Many felt that summer came right after winter.

## Record temperatures

The temperature varies a lot in Finland. The coldest temperature that has ever been measured in Finland is 51.5 degrees below zero. It was measured in Lapland in January 1999.

The hottest temperature in Finland was measured in July 2010. Then it was 37.2 degrees in Joensuu.

We still don't know how hot the weather will be this summer. What is certain, however, is that the weather is also a hot topic this summer.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was spring and early summer weather. Let's say it again.

At the end of April, a back winter hit Finland. It snowed a lot, and it was still available at the beginning of May.

In May, the weather warmed up quickly. More hot days were measured than ever before during May. In the heat, the temperature is over 25 degrees.

Finland's all-time temperature record is 37.2 degrees. Finland's record for freezing is 51.5 degrees again.

This was Uutisviikko in plain Finnish, see you again. Goodbye!
