## The number of schools is decreasing

First, school news.

The number of comprehensive schools will decrease rapidly in the future.

By 2040, there will be only about half of the current number of comprehensive schools.

Then there won't be even one school in all municipalities. The main reason is that fewer children are being born than before.

The birth rate has decreased in almost all of Finland.

For example, in Juua, North Karelia, 77 percent fewer children were born last year than in 2010.

Because the birth rate has fallen, the number of comprehensive schools is rapidly decreasing.

Lempäälä is a small municipality in Pirkanmaa, but it still has many schools. There are large and small schools in Lempäälä.

## University quotas for first-time students

Now about higher education.

The quota for first-time students at higher education institutions has accelerated the start and completion of studies, according to the Ministry of Education and Culture.

Universities must reserve a portion of their study places for first-time students. The quota was introduced in 2016.

However, students are critical of the quota. They believe that it puts pressure on young people. Many also fear that they have chosen the wrong field.

The Ministry of Education believes that the first-time quota has accelerated studies and there are also places for non-first-time students.

## Architecture and Design Museum

Finally, culture.

The design competition for the new architecture and design museum has ended. The new museum will be built in the South Harbour of Helsinki.

The international competition was won by Helsinki-based JKMM architects with a proposal called Kumma. There were over 600 submissions.

The winner is already known for the Tammela Stadium in Tampere, the Amos Rex Museum in Helsinki and the extension of the National Museum, which is currently under construction.

The competition for the Museum of Architecture and Design was won by Helsinki-based JKMM architects with their proposal Kumma.

The design competition was anonymous, meaning nothing was known about the competitors in advance.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will rain tomorrow. However, the sun will shine sometimes.

The temperature is 15 - 20 degrees.
