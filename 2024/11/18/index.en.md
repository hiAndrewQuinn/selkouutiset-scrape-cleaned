Corona disease. Army. Storm. Tuesday's weather.

## Corona disease

First, the topic is corona disease.

The coronavirus disease can sometimes take a really long time.

Some people have had the corona disease for many years.

For example, **Taina** **Hallström** from Lohja has had corona disease for three years already.

He therefore has many difficult symptoms. He gets tired easily and he can't stand the strain.

Sometimes the corona disease lasts a really long time.

Taina Hallström says that it is important that she gets support in the workplace.

No one knows exactly how many people in Finland have a long corona illness.

During the corona pandemic, it was feared that there would be a lot of such people. Fortunately, that has not happened.

The good news is that even a long corona illness gets better with time.

## Army

Then the topic is the Finnish army.

In the future, Finland must spend more money on the military. This is what Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** says.

Prime Minister Orpo says that Finland needs to spend 4 billion euros more on the army than today.

That's a lot of money, when Finland's money is almost gone these days.

Finland needs to spend more money on the army.

The reason is that Finland is a member of the military alliance NATO and Russia in particular is a big threat to Finland.

## Storm

Then the subject of the storm.

There was a storm over the weekend, especially in the eastern part of Finland.

Also in the southern part of Finland, the strong wind knocked down trees on houses and power lines.

For example, the rescue service in Pirkanmaa therefore had more than 100 tasks.

Due to the weekend storm, almost 45,000 homes were without electricity.

This week, on Wednesday and Thursday, strong wind and rain will pass over Finland again.

## Tuesday's weather

Another weather forecast.

It is snowing in Western Lapland and the central part of the country.

It can also snow a little in the south.

It's freezing in many places. In the south there are degrees of heat.
