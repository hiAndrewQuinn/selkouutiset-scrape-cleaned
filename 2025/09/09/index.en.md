## Guardianship of the mother or father is not always successful

First, news about taking care of your own parent's affairs.

Many people are surprised when they are not always allowed to make decisions about a sick mother or father.

An adult can decide on their parent's affairs if the parents have made a power of attorney. In the power of attorney, the parents state which matters the adult child can decide on.

A power of attorney comes into effect when the parent is no longer able to make decisions about their own affairs. The reason may be, for example, memory loss.

A power of attorney must be done correctly or it will be rejected. According to authorities, up to 25% of power of attorneys are rejected.

The power of attorney must include, for example, two witnesses. It must also be done in advance, while the parents are still in good health.

Instructions for the power of attorney are available at Suomi.fi.
