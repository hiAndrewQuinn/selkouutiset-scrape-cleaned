NATO change. Immigration. 112-day. Weak ice. Weather.

## NATO change

First, defense policy.

The US plans to transfer control of two NATO command centers to Europeans.

One of the defense alliance command centers is in Naples, Italy, and the other is in Norfolk, USA. Finland is under the NATO Norfolk Command Center.

President of the Republic Alexander Stubb does not confirm the information but says that NATO's development is clear. Europe must take care of its own security more than it has so far.

The US plans to transfer control of two NATO command centers to Europeans.

Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen says that the security situation will not change even though command centers are moving to Europe.

## EU tightens immigration

Then about immigration.

The EU Parliament is tightening the Union's immigration policy.

For example, Parliament approved the introduction of return centres outside the EU.

EU countries can send people who are in the EU without permission to safe third countries.

The EU Parliament is tightening immigration. The Parliament also approved the creation of a list of safe countries.

## 112-day

Today is National 112 Day.

It is a joint EU safety campaign. The aim is to make the number 112 known.

112 is the common emergency number for EU countries. It can also be called without a SIM card.

The emergency number is called when you need, for example, an ambulance or police assistance.

Today is National 112 Day.

The Finnish Emergency Response Centre handled over 2.5 million emergency calls last year. It makes an average of 7,300 emergency calls every day.

## Weak ice

Even more about safety.

The Gulf of Finland Coast Guard warns of weak ice. It is dangerous to move on ice near shipping lanes.

This week, there have been a lot of people moving around near the shipping lanes. Some have even walked across the lane.

The ship's path quickly becomes covered in freezing weather. The ice then looks safe but is weak.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will be cloudy in the south with a little snow in places.

Elsewhere in Finland, the sun is shining in many places.

The weather is getting colder in the central part of the country.
