## Eastern border freight transport

First, news about goods traffic on the eastern border.

Niklas Anttila came second in the men's series of the Frisbee Golf World Championships, i.e. he received a silver medal.

Emilia Soini, on the other hand, won bronze at the European squash championships in Spain.

## Theater Circus Suosalo

More culture.

Actor Martti Suosalo has founded a touring theater.

The Suosalo theater troupe tours with the circus tent in different parts of the country. During August and September, the tent will be set up in five different locations.

The program includes, for example, this monologue play Starman, which speaks in favor of nature conservation.

The auditorium of the tent theater can accommodate 300 people. The atmosphere is intimate, as the audience sits just an arm's length away from the actor.

The tour theater has been a long-time dream of Martti Suosalo. With it, he can also take culture to small towns that don't have their own theater.

## Tuesday's weather
