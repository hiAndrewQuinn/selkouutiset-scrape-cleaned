Israeli soldiers began a major ground operation in Gaza about a week ago.

The Israeli army has advanced into the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. Prior to the ground operation, Israel carried out airstrikes on Gaza.

People in Gaza are starving. Israel has allowed aid trucks into Gaza, carrying items such as flour and medicine. The UN hopes that food can be distributed soon. Many organizations say the amount of aid is too small.

Israel wants to relocate the people of Gaza to a small area in the southern part of Gaza. This is a war crime.
