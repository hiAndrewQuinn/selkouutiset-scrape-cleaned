*Note! Due to a technical problem, the video does not have subtitles.*

## Ceasefire

First, the topic of the ceasefire in Ukraine.

Russian President **Vladimir Putin** spoke about the ceasefire in Ukraine on Thursday.

The US has proposed a 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine has accepted the ceasefire. Russia has not said what it thinks.

On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for the first time about a ceasefire.

He said that a ceasefire alone is not enough, there must be real peace.

However, Putin has many conditions for peace.

Putin wants to dictate to Ukraine, even though Ukraine is an independent state.

He wants to say what Ukraine can and cannot do.

Putin also wants a large part of Ukraine to be annexed to Russia.

## Trial

Then the subject of the trial.

The murder trial of **Janne Puhakka** began on Thursday.

Janne Puhakka was a former ice hockey player. He was a well-known person.

Puhakka died last fall when her ex-boyfriend killed her.

Puhakka and her ex-boyfriend had broken up a short time ago.

The trial for the murder of Joona Puhakka began on Thursday.

Puhakka's ex-boyfriend **Rolf Nordmo** admits that he killed Puhakka. He shot Puhakka with a shotgun.

The boyfriend still denies that he planned it in advance.

## Norovirus

Then the topic is health.

Norovirus is now circulating in Finland. Norovirus can cause a bad stomach illness in humans.

For example, there are a lot of stomach illnesses in the parliament. The cause of the illness is probably norovirus.

There is a lot of norovirus in Finland again. It is normal in early winter.

Symptoms of norovirus can include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Norovirus spreads less if people wash their hands often enough.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

On Saturday, there will be a few degrees above zero in the southern and central parts of the country.

It's freezing in the north. It's snowing in the central part of the country.

*Correction 14.3. at 17.08: There is a name error in the Selkuutinen video in the Oikeudenk√§ynti news item. The person's real name is Janne Puhakka, not Joona Puhakka.*
