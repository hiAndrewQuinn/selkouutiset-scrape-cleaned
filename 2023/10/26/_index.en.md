The trial of the data breach in the office has started. Vastaamo was a company that gave people psychotherapy.

In the lawsuit, Aleksanteri Kivimäki is accused of first breaking into Vastaamo's customer information. Prosecutors say that after the data breach, Kivimäki brutally blackmailed tens of thousands of people. Kivimäki also published Vastaamo's customer information on the internet.

The prosecutors demand that Kivimäki should be given a 7-year prison sentence.

Aleksanteri Kivimäki says that he has not committed the crimes he is accused of.

### Eastern border fence

A fence is being built on Finland's eastern border. The construction of the fence will start in April.

First, the fence will be built in Southeastern Finland near the border crossings for Imatra, Vaalimaa and Nuijamaa. When the fence is finished, it will be about 200 kilometers long in total. The entire fence will be ready in 2026.

The Border Guard has already built a small fence at Imatra. The Border Guard says that there are good experiences with this test fence.

The purpose of the fence is that you cannot easily cross the border between Finland and Russia without a permit.

### Forest Board

Forest company Metsä Board may lay off employees.

The change negotiations concern a total of approximately 1,100 people at Metsä Board's Finnish cardboard factories. There will probably be layoffs next year and they will last 3 months.

Metsä Board says that too little cardboard is being bought now. Therefore, the company may have to lay off employees.

### Horse riding accident
