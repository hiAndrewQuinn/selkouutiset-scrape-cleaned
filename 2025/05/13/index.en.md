Unemployment. Opera Horseman. Ice Hockey World Championship gold team. Weather.

## Unemployment has worsened

First, about unemployment in Finland.

Unemployment has worsened in 2 years.

There are now over 60,000 more unemployed people in Finland than in 2023. There are only half as many job vacancies as there were 2 years ago.

There can be several hundred applicants for one job.

A Helsinki man applied for about 100 jobs over the course of a year. This spring, he got a job and started his summer job this month.

He said that a year of job searching felt like a long time.

Unemployment has worsened in 2 years.

In Finland, it is expected that employment may improve. This will be influenced by lower interest rates, lower inflation (prices), and higher wages.

## Opera The Horseman

Then Finnish opera.

Composer Aulis Sallinen is celebrating his 90th birthday.

Sallinen's opera The Horseman is being performed for the first time at the Finnish National Opera.

The Horseman premiered 50 years ago at the Savonlinna Opera Festival.

The Horseman is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War, when two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union and their allies, were at odds.

The Horseman has now been directed by Jussi Nikkilä. The opera tells of a future where the threats of today are real. In the opera, Finland is a no-man's land between the great powers.

*- An opera score is usually like a kaleidoscope that can be made to reflect a great many different things.*

## Ice Hockey World Championship gold team

Finally, sports and nostalgia.

Finland won the men's ice hockey world championship 30 years ago.

It was Finland's first World Championship gold medal in discus. Finland defeated Sweden 4–1 in the final in Stockholm.

The first gold medal was an important event for Finns, one that is still remembered today.

The 1995 gold team has been meeting every 10 years. The team met again last night in Stockholm.

*- Usually when we came to Finland, we didn't realize how big a deal it was and that hula hoopla lasted the whole summer.*

Yesterday, Sweden beat Finland 2 - 1.

## Weather

Still a weather forecast.

Tomorrow it will rain in varying amounts. It could rain a lot at once.

In the south it is about 10 degrees Celsius, in the north it is 5 - 11.

The wind is gusty.
