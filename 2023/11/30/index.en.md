The UN refugee agency UNHCR is concerned about the closure of Finland's eastern border. The refugee organization says that closing the border could weaken people's chances of applying for asylum.

I closed the entire eastern border of Finland last night. All border crossings are closed for two weeks. During that time, you can apply for asylum in Finland only at ports and airports.

The eastern border was closed because Russia brought asylum seekers to the border.

### Fazer terminates

The food company Fazer is laying off dozens of people.

Fazer is laying off 64 employees from the Kouvola factory. Fazer has already dismissed around 80 employees from the same factory earlier this year.

Fazer justifies the reductions by the fact that the production of oat milk is being moved from Kouvola to Sweden. In the future, oat yogurts, or gurts, will be made at the Kouvola factory.

### Party support

The Kokoumu has become the most popular party in Finland again. In Yle's new support survey, 22.6 percent of Finns support the coalition.

In the previous measurement, SDP was on top. Now SDP is second, right on the heels of the coalition.

The third most popular are basic Finns. Its support is 17 percent.

The changes from the previous support survey in October were very small.

### UN climate conference

The UN climate conference has started in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

At the meeting, for the first time, a broad overview of how the climate goals of the world's countries have been realized will be made. In 2015, at the Paris Climate Conference, the goal was to limit the warming of the Earth's atmosphere to 1.5 degrees.

Finland has emphasized that climate action is urgent and that climate policy must also be tightened in non-EU countries.

### The warmest year on record

This year will be the warmest on record, estimates the World Meteorological Organization WMO.

The WMO report states that the Earth's climate has now warmed by 1.4 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.

Scientists believe that global warming will continue at a rapid pace next year as well.

On Friday, the weather will be mostly cloudy. It may snow a little in Lapland and the southern part of the country.

It's five to fifteen degrees below zero.

In the north, the driving weather is bad in some places.
