Finns' legs have grown. Men and women buy bigger shoes than before

Shoe retailers say that 41 is a very common shoe size for women these days. Many women have a shoe size of up to 43.

The most common shoe size for men is 43, but much larger sizes are also being sold more and more.

According to researchers, Finns' feet have grown because the standard of living has risen. People get taller and legs grow when they have a good standard of living and plenty of food.

### Weather

It may snow a little on Wednesday. The temperature is between -3 and -10 degrees.
