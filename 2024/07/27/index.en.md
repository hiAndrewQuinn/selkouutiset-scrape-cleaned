In the United States, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party changes. President Joe Biden announced a week ago that he will give up his candidacy, meaning he will no longer run for president in the fall elections.

The 81-year-old Biden's announcement was not a surprise. In the United States, there has been a lot of talk about Biden's health and whether he is too old to be president.

Many members of the Democratic Party, funders and supporters said it was better for Biden to drop out of the presidential race. They did not believe that Biden would be able to beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.

## Kamala Harris gets support

The Democratic Party is now choosing its new presidential candidate. The new candidate will almost certainly be the current Vice President Kamala Harris.

President Joe Biden has said he supports Harris. Many other important Democratic politicians, such as former President Barack Obama, have also already said they support Harris.

Harris' selection as a presidential candidate will be confirmed in August.

## Prosecutor from California

Kamala Harris is 59 years old and comes from California. Harris's mother originally comes from India and his father from Jamaica, so he is a child of immigrants.

Harris studied law. He has been, for example, a prosecutor and the attorney general of the state of California.

In the first campaign speech, Kamala Harris said that she supports, for example, women's right to abortion and wants to tighten US gun laws. He also joked that he has met many villains in his work as a prosecutor. So men like Donald Trump are familiar to him.
