Wine sales. Dental care. Easter. Friday weather.

## Wine sales locations

First, news about politics.

The government has studied the liberalization of wine sales. The study examined 3 different models.

One model is if the sale of wines is allowed in grocery stores.

Another model is if wine sales are allowed from restaurants to your home.

The third model is if the sale of wines is allowed in private wine shops.

Now wine can only be sold at Alko. If sales are also allowed elsewhere, it will have both benefits and disadvantages. This is what investigator **Antti Neimala** says.

Wine is easy to buy and prices may decrease if the number of sales outlets increases.

However, the harms of alcohol then increase. The harms accumulate in people who drink a lot of alcohol.

The government has investigated the liberalization of wine sales.

The issue is politically difficult. For example, the Christian Democrats oppose the liberalization of wine sales.

## Traveling dentist

Now, news about dental care for young people.

Finland is experimenting with a traveling dentist in schools.

This dentist's chair, lamp and other equipment fit into a large bag.

Here they have been brought into a regular school classroom.

It is easy for students to come for a dental check-up. They don't have to be away from class for a long time and parents don't have to spend time transporting their children.

A mobile dentist is being trialled in schools in Kymenlaakso.

4th grader **Ohto Bäckström** liked it when the dental check-up was done at school.

*"I think this is much better than having to go somewhere away from school."*

## Easter

Finally, a word about Easter.

Today, Maundy Thursday, is the busiest day for Easter travel.

Traffic will also be busy tomorrow, Friday, in the morning.

Many Finns travel during Easter, for example to visit relatives, to their cottages or to ski resorts.

Easter also affects many services.

For example, on Good Friday and Easter Monday, offices and banks are closed. Shopping centers are open, but their opening hours may be shorter than on weekdays.

**The next TV broadcast of Selkuuutinen will be on Tuesday, April 22.**

## Friday weather

Still a weather forecast.

The sun will shine in the south and east on Friday.

It will be cloudy elsewhere. There will be some rain in Lapland.

The temperature may rise to close to 25 degrees in the south.

The weather will cool down and become rainier in places over the weekend.
