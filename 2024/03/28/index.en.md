Electric car charging. Stubb's provincial trip. Weather.

## Electric car charging

First, news about electric cars.

Charging an electric car will soon be easier.

The chargers will have a payment terminal. Then you can also charge the electric car with a regular bank and credit card.

New chargers must have a payment terminal already from mid-April.

A payment terminal must be installed on old chargers by the beginning of 2027.

So charging an electric car will soon be easier.

We hope that card payments will increase the popularity of electric cars.

Also in the future, the electric car can be charged with mobile applications and remote tags. These payment methods will not go out of use.

## Stubbin's County trip

Then news about the president.

President Alexander Stubb has made his first trip to the province.

During the provincial trips, the president gets to know the different regions of Finland. The destination of Stubb's first provincial trip was Eastern Finland.

Alexander Stubb and Suzanne Innes-Stubb started their journey from the eastern border of Finland. The presidential couple got to know the work of the border guards.

The presidential couple also visited Joensuu. There they met, for example, city decision-makers and schoolchildren.

President Stubb has made a provincial trip to Eastern Finland.

People were interested in the new president. Joensuu's tori was full of people when the president arrived.

## Friday weather

Then the weather forecast.

On Friday, it will rain or snow in many places.

It is sunny in Northern Lapland.

The temperature mainly varies between -2 and +6 degrees.

## Easter

At the weekend, Easter is celebrated in Finland.

The Easter holidays start tomorrow, Friday, or Good Friday.

Public holidays continue until Monday. Then it is Easter Monday, i.e. the second day of Easter.

Easter affects traffic schedules, for example.

For example, in the Helsinki region, buses and trams follow Sunday schedules also on Good Friday and Easter Monday.

Because of Easter, the next time the news will be shown on TV is only on Tuesday.

The weekend Uutisviikko selkosuomeksi programs will, however, appear on the radio and on selkouuti's websites as normal.

A very happy Easter to everyone!
