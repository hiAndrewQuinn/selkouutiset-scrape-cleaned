The majority of Finns are satisfied with taxation. The Tax Administration has asked Finns what they think about paying taxes.

More than 70 percent of Finns are happy to pay taxes.

Only 17 percent of Finns say they don't like paying taxes. However, most of them are of the opinion that taxes must still be paid.

Satisfaction with paying taxes has clearly increased over the past 10 years.

A big earthquake has happened in Nepal. The earthquake occurred in western Nepal on Friday evening.

At least 150 people have died in the earthquake. The number of dead may rise when more information is obtained from the area. Many people have also been injured in the Nepal earthquake. Many buildings collapsed in the earthquake.

The Nepal earthquake happened in a remote area. That's why information about the destruction comes slowly.

As many as one million people have moved from Gaza to the southern part of the territory because of the war.

Experts say at least 800,000 people have entered the area, but the number could be as high as a million. This is what the US Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Aid says.

The strikes by the Israeli air force and ground forces have been concentrated in northern Gaza. That's why people have fled south. There are still about 400,000 people in northern Gaza.

Today Saturday is All Saints' Day. All Saints' Day is important in the Christian tradition. It is the day of remembrance of saints, martyrs and the dead.

On All Saints' Day, we remember close people who have already died. On All Saints' Day, candles are taken to the graves of loved ones. Churches remember those parishioners who have died since the last All Saints' Day.
