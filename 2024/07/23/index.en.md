Mobile phone ban trial. Asylum seekers' bicycles. Animal parks. Weather.

## Smartphone ban experiment

At first, about phones in schools.

The researcher presents an experiment to some schools in which smartphones are completely banned. Ramin Izadi says that the bans abroad have become effective.

For example, in the English study, especially the results of students with lower levels improved. In Norway, it was noticed that bullying decreased.

Izadi is a researcher at the State Economic Research Center. Izadi presents an experiment in which smartphones are completely banned in some schools.

The government is preparing mobile phone restrictions in schools, but it is not yet known what kind.

## Asylum seekers' bicycles

Then about the phenomenon in the asylum seeker.

Asylum seekers' bicycles have been auctioned in Salla, Lapland.

Over the course of 8 months, almost 250 asylum seekers came to Lapland from Russia through the eastern border. They had to either customs the bikes or hand them over to the state.

Russia only allowed crossing the border with a vehicle, but Finland forbade cycling across the border.

Asylum seekers' bicycles have been auctioned in Salla, Lapland. There were 190 bicycles for sale at the customs auction.

From last fall to spring, a total of more than 1,300 asylum seekers came to Finland through the eastern border.

Currently, the entire land border between Finland and Russia is closed. The goal is to stop instrumentalized immigration, where Russia organizes people to cross the border.

## Zoo prices

Still about the prices of summer destinations.

Zoos have raised ticket prices.

For example, in Helsinki's Korkeasaari, admission for a family of 4 costs a total of around 100 euros.

Korkeasaari's children's ticket price has almost doubled in 4 years. Korkeasaari justifies the price increase with the fact that costs have risen.

In Ähtäri Zoo, the entrance fee for a family of 4 costs 114 euros. Prices were raised a few years ago.

## Weather

Another weather forecast.

There will be showers and thunderstorms in the western part of the country. In places, it can rain a lot at once.

It's sunny elsewhere.

The temperature is 25 to 30 degrees. It is colder in rainy areas.
