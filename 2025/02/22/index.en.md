USA, Europe and the war in Ukraine

The topic of this week's news is the war in Ukraine.

The big war in Ukraine started 3 years ago.

Then Russia attacked Ukraine with full force.

The USA has helped Ukraine in the war, but now the USA has a new president, **Donald Trump**. He does not want to help Ukraine.

Now we will tell you more about it.

## 3 years of war

The big war in Ukraine began 3 years ago when Russia invaded.

Russia has occupied a lot of territory in Ukraine. A lot of people have died.

The previous US president **Joe Biden** helped Ukraine a lot when Ukraine defended itself.

The new US President Donald Trump no longer wants to help Ukraine.

That's why Trump wants the war in Ukraine to end quickly.

## Will Russia win the war?

Russian President **Vladimir Putin** wants to take over Ukraine.

That's why he has started a big war in Ukraine.

US President Trump and Russian President Putin recently spoke on the phone about the war in Ukraine.

They will meet soon.

Europe fears that Trump may not care what happens to Ukraine.

Ukraine may lose a lot of territory.

If there is a pause in the war, Russia may be able to attack again later.

Then Russia can think that it is the winner of the war.

It may be that Russia then wants to attack a new country in Europe.

This is causing concern in Russia's neighboring countries, for example Finland.

## Big concern in Europe

There is great concern in Europe about US President Donald Trump.

Historically, the US military has defended Europe. That's why the big European countries have weak militaries.

President Trump thinks it's stupid for the US to defend Europe and spend money on it.

Trump does not want the US to defend Europe anymore in the future.

Europeans are now thinking a lot about what to do.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week this time was the USA, Europe and the war in Ukraine.

Europe fears that Russia will win the war in Ukraine.

The reason is that US President Donald Trump does not want to help Ukraine.

If Russia wins, the security of Europe and Finland may be worse.
