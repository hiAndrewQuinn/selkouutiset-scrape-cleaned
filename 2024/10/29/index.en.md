Welfare areas. Ethiopian nurses. Winter driving. Weather.

## Welfare areas

First, news about health services.

There are money problems in welfare areas.

Welfare areas take care of social and health services.

Many welfare regions spend more money than they receive from the state.

That's why they have money problems.

The government has ordered that the welfare regions must get their financial affairs in order by the end of 2026.

The welfare regions fear that the services will deteriorate if the welfare regions have to make savings as quickly as the government has ordered.

## Ethiopian nurses

Then news about the nurses.

A group of Ethiopian nurses have found themselves in a difficult situation in Finland.

These nurses came to Finland from Ethiopia last spring. A job awaited them at Attendo, which has nursing homes in Finland.

However, the women received an email that they were being fired. So they no longer have a job. Therefore, they can be deported from Finland.

Attendo fired the Ethiopian nurses because the papers of all the nurses might not be correct.

These nurses say that they have all the papers in order and correct. Therefore, they do not understand why they are not allowed to start work.
