Polarization of youth

The topic of the news week this time is the polarization of young people, i.e. the differentiation of young people's thoughts.

The thoughts of girls and boys differ more than before. It also increases sensitivity to information influence.

We will now tell you more about the polarization of young people.

## Growth of polarization

The values and thoughts of girls and boys have diverged more strongly than before. This is what the studies say.

For example, young women's values are more liberal than before and young men's values are more traditional than before.

The different thinking of girls and boys has increased, i.e. polarized.

The attitudes of young people are most divided in values and identity. Such issues include, for example, sexuality, gender, immigration, racism and climate change.

## A worldwide phenomenon

Polarization happens when people need to take a stand on something for or against.

People feel that they are standing up for the right cause. At the same time, they feel that other people are defending the wrong cause.

Polarization is a global phenomenon. There has been a polarization between men and women in many countries over the last 10 years or so.

The polarization of young people has increased in Finland, especially in the 2020s.

## Information influencing

Some parties can benefit from polarization. Polarization can be increased by influencing information in, for example, social media.

For example, political leaders, a party or an extremist group can benefit from polarization. They can tell things in a way that makes other people or groups look like enemies.

Informational influence can, for example, create an image of a threat, e.g. immigration. This is how you gather popularity from the opponents of the matter.

## The feeling of being outside

Many young people feel that they have been left out in Finland. This is what the research says.

Authorities, politicians, teachers and the media seem distant to young people.

That's why truths, opinions and influencers feel good on social media and the internet.

Also, some politicians present themselves in such a way that young people like them.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week this time was the polarization of young people.

Let's repeat the most important things.

Young people's thinking and values are more strongly divided than before. The phenomenon is called polarization.

Polarization can continue so that groups of different opinions are unable to discuss issues.

For example, extremist groups or politicians can benefit from polarization.
