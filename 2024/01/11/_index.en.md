## Age and having children

First, the news about having children.

In Finland, more and more women under the age of 35 are childless. There are 73 percent of them. In 2017, the number was 65 percent.

At the same time, people over 35 give birth to more children than before.

People under the age of 30 most often want children. Men of all ages want children more often than women.

## Violations of conscripts

Then about the army and social media.

The defense forces have filed criminal reports for filming without permission.

Last year, the Defense Forces made at least 3 criminal reports about conscripts who shared photos in violation of regulations.

In one case, a conscript filmed without permission in an area classified as critical. The acts are being investigated under the title disclosure of a security secret. The minimum penalty in the Criminal Code is 4 months in prison.

The defense forces have filed criminal reports for filming without permission.

Jääkäri Abdikarim Mohamud is a conscript in the Pori Brigade. He knows where you can't photograph or what you can put on social media.

\- Did you do a lot of drugs yourself during your time as a conscript?

\- I haven't done it myself, I haven't dared, because I don't want to do anything like a service crime or anything like that, so I've kept everything private.
