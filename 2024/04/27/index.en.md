Kela has published this year's maternity package. Maternity packaging has been a Finnish specialty.

The maternity package contains clothes and accessories for the baby. Maternity allowance is a maternity package or 170 euros in cash.

The maternity allowance or package is available if the parent belongs to Finnish social security. Adoptive parents also receive a maternity package.

The maternity package does not depend on the gender of the parent: the package is also available to a male couple who has adopted a child.

The maternity package must be requested from Kela no later than 2 months before the child's birth.

## The history of the maternity pack

The first maternity packages were distributed even before the wars in 1938. At first, the aid was given to mothers with a poor financial status. Nowadays, packaging is offered to everyone.

About two-thirds of mothers choose a maternity kit. For the first child, 95 percent choose the package.

The law says that the maternity package must meet the needs of the mother and the baby.

## Why does the baby sleep in a box?

The box of the maternity package has been the first bed of many Finnish babies. The Internet story about Finnish babies in a cardboard box has been the British BBC's all-time social hit.

Maternity packages have changed a lot in almost 90 years, but the box is still a good first bed for a child.

Many Finns think that a maternity package is a matter of course. However, it is a unique aid package that has been modeled on in many countries.

This year, some of the clothes are designed so that the legs and sleeves can be adjusted by turning. Therefore, the baby can wear the clothes for a long time.
