## Members of Parliament

First, the topic of MPs.

There has been a big commotion in Parliament because of two MPs.

Basic Finnish MPs **Teemu Keskisarja** and **Sheikki Laakso** said that they will not go to Linna's party on Independence Day.

The castle celebration is organized by the president of the republic. He invites, among other things, all MPs to the party.

MPs Keskisarja and Laakso said they would rather go to the 612 parade on Independence Day.

There was a big uproar in the Parliament because of the decision of Keskisarijan and Laakso.

Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** says that the 612 march is an extreme right-wing event.

In Orpo's opinion, a member of parliament should not participate in such an event.

MP Sheikki Laakso said after the uproar that he will leave the 612 procession.
