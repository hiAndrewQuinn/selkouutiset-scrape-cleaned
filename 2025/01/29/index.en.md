Caring for yourself. A hobby experiment for high schools. Living in cramped conditions. Weather.

## Parental care

Initially, the topic is caregivers.

Almost half of Finns believe that adult children should care for their own aging parents.

This is evident from a new survey.

The justification for increasing the care responsibilities of relatives is that public finances are suffering from a shortage of funds.

Around 30 percent also believe that the role of caregiver is better suited to women than men. This is especially true of young men.

Finns believe that adult children's responsibility for caring for their own parents can be increased.

85-year-old Olavi Hasunen disagrees.

\- The children have so much to do these days that I wouldn't want to put that burden on them.

## Hobby experiment for young people

Then we'll tell you about a new hobby experiment.

An experiment will begin in upper secondary schools next fall, where young people can try out different hobbies.

You can try out hobbies for free during the school day.

Hobbies are chosen according to the young people's wishes.

In a survey of schoolchildren, the most popular desired hobby was gym training.

There will be hobby experiments in upper secondary schools in the fall.

The Ministry of Education says that 20 percent of middle school students do not do any sports.

The goal of the experiment is for every young person to find a hobby they enjoy.

## Cramped apartments

Then there is the issue of housing.

More and more Finns live in cramped conditions.

Statistics Finland reports that just under 900,000 people lived in overcrowded housing at the end of 2023. The number was slightly higher than the year before.

A person lives in a cramped apartment if there is more than 1 person living in a room, not counting the kitchen.

The Helsinki region has the highest number of people living in cramped conditions.

Elina and Eino Havu live in a studio apartment in Kruununhaka, Helsinki. Mother and son say that the space is more than enough for them.

## Thursday's weather

Still a weather forecast.

It will snow in the north and west tomorrow.

That's why driving a car can be dangerous.

There is little rain in the east and the temperature is above zero.
