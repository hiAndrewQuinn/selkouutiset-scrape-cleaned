Party themes in municipal elections

In the elections in two weeks, regional councils will be elected for welfare areas and municipal councils for municipalities.

Yesterday we talked about the regional elections, now we're talking about the municipal elections.

Education is one of the most important issues decided by the municipal council.

We will now explain how the parliamentary parties want to develop education.

## Center Party, National Coalition Party and Christian Democrats

The center supports local schools in municipalities and city districts. For example, languages and optional subjects such as music can also be taught remotely.

The education must be so good and diverse that the family does not have to look for a better school outside their own area.

The Coalition Party wants all children to start early childhood education at the age of 3. Families can be given a service voucher for private daycare.

In primary school, you need to learn to read and write well enough. In school, you also need to learn how society works.

The Christian Democrats believe that home care for young children should be secured. The party recommends daycare for children with an immigrant background.

Teaching should include familiarization with Finnish Christian traditions.

## Movement Now, Finns Party and RKP

Movement Now requires small enough groups for schools and daycare centers. Schools must promote well-being and teach manners.

Finns-led parties believe that you can only get a certificate from comprehensive school if you know enough things. Everyone must know the Finnish language.

The party wants the level courses and observation classes back. Students have the right to receive instruction from a teacher and not have to search for information themselves.

The Swedish People's Party (RKP) wants children to attend early childhood education. It should be made free in the future.

## SDP, Left Alliance and Greens

The SDP, or Social Democrats, say that there should be a maximum of 20 students in a primary school class.

Every child should know enough Finnish when they start school. That is why S2 education, or Finnish or Swedish as a second language, needs to be increased.

The Left Alliance believes that the municipality should organize early childhood education. Private daycare should be limited.

Literacy must become a key project in education.

The Greens want schools to work on literacy and reading skills. In addition to electronic materials, students should also be offered textbooks.

The municipal elections are on April 13th.
