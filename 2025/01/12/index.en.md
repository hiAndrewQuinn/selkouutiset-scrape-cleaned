Lapland tourism

There are a lot of tourists visiting Finnish Lapland.

This winter, more tourists will visit Lapland than ever before.

That's a good thing because tourists bring money and jobs to Lapland and Finland.

However, there are also some problems with this, which we will now explain in more detail.

## New record

Lapland will probably see a record number of tourists this winter.

Many tourists come to Lapland from Britain, for example.

People often come to Lapland for the winter and snow.

Many people visit Lapland during Christmas.

Rovaniemi in Lapland is the official hometown of Santa Claus.

For example, many Asians also like the Northern Lights.

The Northern Lights only occur near the North Pole and near the South Pole.

## More flights

For tourists, more than 40 regular flights from other countries will fly to Rovaniemi Airport this winter.

That's 2 times more than last winter.

Sometimes there are so many tourists at Rovaniemi Airport that not everyone can fit in.

Then they have to wait outside in the bitter cold.

## Housing problems

Lapland tourists bring a lot of money to Finland.

Still, the large number of tourists also brings some problems to Lapland.

Minor car accidents happen because tourists don't know how to drive in winter weather.

In the city of Rovaniemi, many tourists live in apartments in apartment buildings.

It sometimes annoys ordinary people.

Sometimes tourists disturb neighbors and cause noise, for example.

In addition, because of tourists, there are fewer apartments for other people.

## The government is thinking

Short-term rentals of apartments to tourists sometimes irritate neighbors when there are a lot of tourists.

Some people in Rovaniemi have complained to the authorities about the matter.

The Finnish government is also considering the matter.

In the future, the housing company may be able to prohibit short-term rentals of apartments.

## Repetition

This time, the topic of Uutisviikko was tourism in Lapland. Let's recap the most important things.

More and more tourists are visiting Lapland.

It is good for the economy of Lapland and Finland.

Tourists in Lapland also cause some problems, for example in apartments.
