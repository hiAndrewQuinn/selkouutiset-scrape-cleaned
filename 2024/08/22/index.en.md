There is a dispute in the government about immigration.

RKP wants the assessment of the availability of foreign labor to be stopped. Basic Finns and the coalition oppose the proposal.

## Vegetable recommendation

Now news about vegetables.

Experts give a new nutritional recommendation. According to it, a person should eat 800 grams of different vegetables every day. The old recommendation was 500 grams of vegetables per day.

The new nutritional recommendation also says that red meat should be eaten sparingly.

A person should eat 800 grams of root vegetables, fruits and berries per day.
