## The state's financial situation

First, news about government money.

The financial situation of the Finnish state is difficult.

Finance Minister Riikka Purra told yesterday what the state's financial situation will look like next year.

Purra says that the government's income will be 76 billion euros next year, but the expenses will be more than 88 billion euros.

It means that the state has to take on a new debt of more than 12 billion euros.

It is more than was estimated in the spring.

Purra says that, for example, social and health services spend more money than estimated.

The financial situation of the Finnish state is difficult.

The government has already decided on many savings, but their goals are not always reached.

That's why Purra suggests that next year the state gives less money to, for example, church activities.

Purra also plans to reduce the money that the state gives to municipalities for integration services.

Decisions about the state's money for next year will be made later in the fall.

## Review by employees

Then the matter of working life.

Employees are often criticized in public these days. This is what the Occupational Safety and Health Center says.

For example, restaurant customers can write about chefs and waiters on the website.

The Center for Occupational Safety says that employers should think about how they support employees who are criticized online.

night shifters are often publicly criticized.

## Kittil채's new school

Finally, we will visit Kittil채's new school.

School work has started in Finland this week.

In Kittil채's church village, primary school children got into a new and beautiful log school. The building cost 17 million euros.

The schoolchildren like the new school, because they have been in evacuation rooms for a long time due to indoor air problems.
