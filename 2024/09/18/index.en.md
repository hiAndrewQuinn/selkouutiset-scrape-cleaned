Commissioner of Finland. A new drug. Electric airplane. Thursday's weather.

## Commissioner of Finland

First news about the European Union.

Finland will have an important role in the European Commission.

The Commission implements European Union policy. That is why it affects the lives of all Europeans.

The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, introduced the new members of the Commission, i.e. the Commissioners, yesterday.

Each EU country has one commissioner in the commission. The Finnish commissioner is Henna Virkkunen.

Virkkunen starts handling matters related to technology, security and democracy. Virkkus will also become vice-chairman of the commission.

Finland will therefore have an important role in the European Commission.

Prime Minister Petteri Orpo is satisfied. The task is exactly what Finland wanted.

The new commissioners can start work after they have been approved by the European Parliament.

## A new drug

Then the topic is narcotics, i.e. drugs.

A new drug has spread to Finland.

The conversion drug alpha-PVP, or thumb, has spread quickly in Helsinki and other parts of southern Finland.

Most of the thumb is imported to Finland from Central Europe.

So a new drug, which is known on the street as peukku, has spread to Finland.

Thumb is a strong drug. It often makes users violent. It is difficult for others to know how thumb users behave.

Thumb also causes mental health problems and weakens physical condition.

## Electric airplane

Then the topic is an electric plane.

Electric airplanes will soon enter passenger traffic.

Here, a Swedish electric plane is being designed.

It uses hybrid technology. At the beginning of the trip, it flies with electricity. When the batteries run out, the plane's normal engines start.

The plane is charged with the same power as 30 electric cars.

Electric airplanes will soon enter passenger traffic.

The Swedish plane will start carrying passengers maybe in 5 years.

## Thursday's weather

Another weather forecast.

On Thursday, the weather will be cloudy. The sun is shining in a large part of the country. It can rain in Lapland.

In the north, the temperature is below 20 degrees, elsewhere the temperature can be over 20 degrees.
