Defense industry. Berry farming. Kenyan students. Wednesday's weather.

## Defense industry

First, the topic is the defense industry.

Finland's defense industry is growing. This is what a new report says.

The defense industry manufactures weapons and other supplies for national defense.

Customers of the Finnish defense industry are especially the armies of Finland and other NATO countries.

There are approximately 370 companies operating in the defense industry in Finland. Many of them grow quickly.

Finland's defense industry is doing well.

Many companies in the field manufacture supplies for both military and civilian use.

A company can grow quickly when it manufactures a wide variety of accessories.

## Berry farming

Then the topic is berries.

Berry cultivation is being developed in southwestern Finland.

The Laatumarja project is underway in the area.

Berry grower Tanja Vennelä wants to learn more about blueberry and its cultivation.

Vennelä says that the conditions for berry cultivation are good in southwestern Finland. The growing season is long.

In southwestern Finland, berry cultivation is being developed, for example currant cultivation.

One goal is to find new berry varieties that thrive in Finland's bright summer.

## Kenyan students

Then we will talk about the Kenyan students.

A group of Kenyan students got into trouble in Finland. The students ran out of money.

There was a fee to study, but fraudsters took part of the student loan money in Kenya.

It also happened to **Susan Cheptepkeny** and **Ruth Chemutai**. They cleaned and collected bottles, but the money was not enough to study.

Kenyan students got into trouble in Finland.

Yle made a program about students a year ago. After that, many Finns helped the students. [One of the helpers was the musician Paula Vesala](https://areena.yle.fi/1-66871383).

Now Susan and Ruth work in the care industry. My dream is to study to become a nurse.
