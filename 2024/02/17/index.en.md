The winner of the presidential election, Alexander Stubb, met with international journalists shortly after the election. The reporters wanted to know what Stubb thinks about Finland's neighboring country, Russia.

Stubb said that previously the relationship with Russia was an important part of Finland's foreign policy. However, the situation changed when Russia invaded Ukraine. Now Finland has no relations with Russian leaders.

The most important parts of Finland's foreign policy are now the European Union and the defense alliance NATO, Stubb said.

## USA and NATO

Stubb also took a stand on the Americans' NATO discussion.

In the USA, Donald Trump is running for the presidency again. In Trump's opinion, the USA does not need to defend NATO countries that do not spend enough money on defense.

Stubb said that election speeches are always louder in the USA than in Finland.

However, in Stubb's opinion, European countries must remember their responsibility in NATO. Finland already spends as much money on defense as agreed in NATO.

## Sweden

And which country is the new president going to visit first?

In Sweden, said Stubb.

It is a tradition in Finland that the new president makes his first trip abroad to Sweden.

Stubb also has a lot of personal relationships with Sweden. Stubb is bilingual, he speaks Swedish and Finnish equally well.

Stubb received many congratulations from Sweden after the election victory. Congratulations were sent, for example, by Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and Stubb's friend Prince Daniel.

## Repeat

The topic of the news week was the meeting between the next president of Finland, Alexander Stubb, and journalists.

Stubb told reporters that the most important parts of Finland's foreign policy are now the EU and NATO. There are no relations with Russian leaders.

In Stubb's opinion, Finland fulfills its obligations in NATO well.

Stubb plans to make his first foreign trip as president to Sweden.
