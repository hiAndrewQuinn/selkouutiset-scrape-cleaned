New immigrants from Russia have come to Finland. 55 migrants arrived at the Raja-Joosepi border station on Saturday. The Border Guard says that the arrivals are from Yemen, Morocco, Syria and Algeria.

Yesterday, Friday, only 3 migrants came to the Raja-Joosepi border station.

Only the Raja-Joosepi border station is open between Finland and Russia. The border station of Raja-Joosep is in Inari, in the north. Finland has closed the other border crossings on the eastern border because Russia has started sending migrants to Finland. Finland has stepped up guarding on the eastern border.

Finland does not negotiate with Russia on the migrant situation on the eastern border. This is what Prime Minister **Petteri Orpo** and SDP chairman **Antti Lindtman** say. Russia might want Finland to negotiate with Russia. Maybe that's why Russia sends migrants to Finland. Finland will not accept if Russia pressures Finland into negotiations.

SDP chairman Antti Lindtman says that Russia is trying to destabilize Finland in many ways. The reason is that Russia wants to divert attention away from Ukraine.

Lindtman says that the eastern border can be closed completely if the situation requires it. On Saturday, Lindtman was a guest of Ylen's Ykkösaamu program.

### Eating habits of Finns

There are flaws in the eating habits of Finns. The Institute of Health and Welfare has asked Finns about their eating habits.

Many Finns eat too little fish and vegetables. Only about 30 percent of Finns eat fish at least 2 times a week. The recommendation is that it is good to eat fish at least 2 times a week.

Only 20 percent of men and only 40 percent of women eat vegetables, fruits and berries several times a day. The recommendation is that it is good to eat at least 500 grams of vegetables, berries and fruits per day.

### Kamos

In northern Finland, the kaamos starts today, Saturday. Kaamos means the time when the sun does not rise during the day in the north.

The reason is the position of the Earth. The northern part of the globe remains in shadow for the whole day in winter. Kaamos lasts almost 2 months.

For example, the next time the sun rises on Utsjoki is on January 17. Utsjoki is the northernmost municipality in Finland. There, the darkness lasts longer than further south in Lapland.

The weather on Sunday will be mostly cloudy and dusty. Weak snow showers will occur in some places. The temperature is between -6 and -16 degrees in the southern and central parts of the country, and -20 degrees in the north.
