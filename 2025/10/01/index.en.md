Border control. Restraining orders. Municipal rental housing. Weather.

## New system for border control

First, about border control.

Finland is introducing a new system at border crossings. The new information system EES will first be introduced at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.

The devices store data on citizens coming from outside the EU and the Schengen area, a 29-country European union with no internal border controls, in a common system.

Finland is introducing a new system for border crossings.

The EES system examines, for example, passports and visas. It also includes the passenger's facial images and fingerprints.

When such a passenger re-enters Finland, border control is carried out quickly.

The system identifies people who are traveling with the wrong passport, have overstayed their residence permit, or are planning a terrorist attack.

## Restraining orders are being violated

Now about the restraining order.

Restraining orders are being violated more than before, police say.

A restraining order protects a person from threats, harassment or violence from another person. The order is imposed by law.

This year, over 1,000 bans have already been imposed, a 30 percent increase.

Technical monitoring of restraining orders has been in use in Finland for 2 years. However, leg collars have only been ordered 11 times.

The collar alerts if a person with a restraining order enters a restricted area.

Restraining orders are being violated more than before. Experts believe that leg braces could be used much more often.

## Municipal rental housing

Finally, about rental housing.

There are more municipal rental apartments without residents than ever before. These are rental apartments that were built with state support. At the beginning of the year, almost 10,000 municipal rental apartments were empty throughout the country.

In North Karelia, the municipality of Rääkkylä has solved the problem, says real estate secretary Anne Salin.

If there are many empty apartments in a building, residents will be moved to more full houses.

A total of 18 municipal rental houses in Rääkkylä have been sold, demolished or abandoned.

Around 10,000 municipal rental apartments are empty across the country.

## Weather

Cloudiness may be abundant. There may be some rain on the coast.
