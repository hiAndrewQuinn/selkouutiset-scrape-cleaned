The famous Finnish design company Aarikka turns 70 years old.

Aarikka was founded by Kaija Aarikka. In 1954, he needed just the right details in his art studies. We couldn't find any, so Aarikka carved the buttons herself.

Others also became interested in them, and soon the production expanded to jewelry. This is how the design company was born.

## Wooden jewelry is still in fashion

Aarikka is best known for wood products. Kaija Aarikka already started using domestic wood such as birch and pine in 1959.

Kaija Aarikka started developing colorful, moving and multi-part wooden jewelry. They were different from the previous jewelry tradition.

Aarikka wanted bright colors for the wooden ornaments. He wanted the grain of the wood, i.e. the wood's own patterns, to be visible. Aarikka developed a dyeing method in her own kitchen, which is still in use.

The dyeing process is still a secret.

## More than just wood

Aarika's wooden jewelry was also of interest around the world. In 1955, the French fashion house Dior ordered Aarika's wooden jewelry for its selection.

Aarikka also sold silver jewelry, wool blankets and even clothes. Wooden toys went on sale in the late 1960s.

Kaija Aarikka also designed door curtains, plates, trays and candlesticks.

Aarika's perhaps most famous decorative item is the Ram, of which there are many types.

In the 1980s, Aarikka did well because there was a boom in Finland. There were many more stores. There was an economic recession in the 1990s, but Aarikka survived.

In the 21st century, Kaija Aarikka's daughter Pauliina Aarikka continued as artistic director.

Kaija Aarikka died in 2014, and the company was left to 3 daughters. Since 2017, Aarika has been owned by the Finnish company Martinex Oy.
