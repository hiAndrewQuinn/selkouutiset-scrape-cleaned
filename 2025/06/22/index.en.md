The US has struck Iran. President Donald Trump announced the strikes early Sunday morning Finnish time.

Trump said that the US struck three nuclear facilities in Iran. The main target was the Fordow nuclear power plant. The facility is underground.

The US used B2 bombers in the strikes. They are capable of carrying bombs that drill deep underground.

Trump said the purpose of the strikes was to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

## Is Iran developing a nuclear weapon?

US attacks on Iran have been expected, as the situation in the Middle East is tense.

The US and Iran have been negotiating over Iran's nuclear program, but the talks have not progressed. The US says that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at producing nuclear weapons for Iran. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful and that it is not developing nuclear weapons.

Israel claims that Iran is close to succeeding in producing a nuclear weapon. That's why Israel began bombing Iranian nuclear facilities and military targets a little over a week ago.

Iran has responded by firing missiles at Israel.

Israel and Iran have also struck each other today after the US attack.

## No war, but negotiations

It is not yet known how much damage the US strikes on Iran caused.

President Trump says the strikes were a great success. He says they completely destroyed three nuclear facilities. Trump also threatens Iran with more strikes if it doesn't stop its nuclear program.

Iran, on the other hand, says that the US strikes did not cause major damage.

There are fears around the world that the conflict will escalate into a larger war in the Middle East. Many world leaders say that the US and Iran must now return to the negotiating table.

## Repetition

The topic of the news week was the US attack on Iran.

The US attacked three nuclear facilities in Iran last night.

The purpose of the strikes was to ensure that Iran was unable to build a nuclear weapon.

World leaders hope that the US and Iran will continue negotiations on their nuclear program.
