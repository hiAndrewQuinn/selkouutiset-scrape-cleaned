## Climate change and the economy

First, climate change.

Climate change also affects the economy.

Climate change is already raising the price of food, for example, because global warming is harming agriculture.

If the Earth's climate warms up a lot, the effects of climate change could be really big in the future.

Climate change can affect the economy even as much as war. This is what a new American study says.

Climate change therefore also affects the economy.

The effects are also visible in Finland.

Climate change is already affecting the prices of goods and Finland's trade with other countries.

In the future, storms and floods may also increase in Finland if the climate warms too much.
