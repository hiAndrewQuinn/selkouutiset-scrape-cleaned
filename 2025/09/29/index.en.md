## Expensive medicines

First, about medications.

Expensive medicines cause financial difficulties.

Many people have a long-term illness but no money for medication. The most difficult thing is when the medicine is expensive and you don't get full Kela reimbursement.

Chief Physician Olli Leppänen says that infections, for example, must be treated. Without medication, the patient may suffer permanent damage.

Student Maija Honkanen suffers from an intestinal disease that causes inflammation. She has been without medication for many months because she did not have enough money. Honkanen has had to pay for the medication with her student loan.

Expensive medicines cause financial difficulties.

Kela is currently experimenting with a medicine loan. The aim is to grant low-income people an interest-free loan, or credit, to pay the annual deductible for medicines.

## Wages of Ukrainians in shipyard subcontracting

Then about work life.

Turku Shipyard's subcontractors, i.e. companies outside the shipyard, have made mistakes in paying wages.

Not all Ukrainian workers have received enough pay, according to a report by the Finnish Information Agency (STT).

Ukrainians have worked on weekends, at night, and in shifts of more than 8 hours, but have not been paid extra.

Turku shipyard's subcontractors have made mistakes in paying wages.

The Finnish Industry Federation is demanding that shipyard Meyer Turku intervene in the exploitation of labor in the subcontracting chain. Meyer tells Yle that it is trying to prevent negligence.

## Lotta statue

More art and history.

A statue of Lotta has been unveiled in Tampere.

The women of the Lotta Svärd organization worked in national defense during the war.

From 1939 to 1944, the Lottas were in field hospitals and air surveillance, for example. The Lottas also cooked food for the soldiers and helped transport the wounded.

The Lotta statue has been unveiled in the park of Tampere Cathedral.

## Weather

On Tuesday, the weather will continue to be partly sunny.

Cloudiness is abundant in Southern and Central Lapland and in the western part of the country.

The temperature is close to 10 degrees.
