Veikkaus lottery sales change

The topic of the news week this time is the change in Veikkaus lottery sales.

Lottery sales changed at the beginning of the year. The customer must identify himself if he wants to buy lottery tickets. The change has greatly reduced the sale of lotteries.

We will now tell you more about identification and the change in the sale of lotteries.

## Identification

Many Finns buy lotteries from the gaming company Veikkaus. Lotteries are sold in kiosks and shops and in Veikkaus' online store.

This year, a law came into effect that requires customers to identify themselves when they play money games or buy lottery tickets.

The customer must show an identity card or Veikkaus customer card at the checkout.

The seller of the lottery registers the information of the customer and the lottery in the Veikkaus system. This is how you know to whom the winnings will be paid if you win the lottery.

In the Veikkaus online store, the customer identifies themselves the first time with their bank credentials and later with their username.

The purpose of identification is to facilitate age limit monitoring and reduce gaming disadvantages.

## Decrease in lottery sales

Lottery sales have decreased at the beginning of the year, i.e. between January and June, by around 30 percent. The income from lottery sales, i.e. gaming margin, has decreased by 44 percent.

A little over 500,000 Finns have bought lottery tickets in the beginning of the year. The number is lower than at the same time last year.

The reason is the new identification requirement. Not all people want to reveal their identity if they buy lottery tickets.

Raffle tickets have also been popular gifts. Because of identification, lotteries can no longer be bought as gifts. The lottery is registered to the buyer, and the winnings are paid only to the buyer.

## Various lotteries

Pelifirma Veikkaus has 13 different lotteries for sale this year. The most popular are traditional lotteries, i.e. Ace, Casino and Onnensanat lotteries.

At the beginning of the year, the Pajatso and Hedelmäpeli lotteries were discontinued.

Veikkaus says that traditional lotteries are especially bought by older people. Veikkaus believes that sales of traditional cardboard lottery tickets will continue for a long time, even though sales have decreased.
