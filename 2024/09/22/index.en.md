Early autumn has been record warm. The average temperatures in September have been 4 to 6 degrees higher than normal.

The heat records have continued until this week in Lapland. In Finland's northernmost municipality, Utsjoki, an autumn temperature record of 21.3 degrees was measured.

The summer was also record warm throughout Finland. More than 70 hot days were measured.

The light limit is 25 degrees.

## Heat affects animals

Many animals have suffered from the record heat.

Animals' metabolism is faster than normal in hot weather. Therefore, animals consume more energy.

For example, bears do not get enough food for hibernation.

Hedgehogs and frogs also need food, because they hibernate in the winter. In it, the animal's body temperature drops close to zero.

Salmon like cool water, and long, warm, dry weather is bad for them. Salmon need a lot of water as they move up the river to the spawning grounds to breed.

Insects also suffer from excessively warm weather. That's why there are fewer insect species than normal during the near summers.

## Warm sea

The sea water has been record warm even in September.

There has been a strong heat wave in the Gulf of Finland and the Red Sea. The sea temperature there has been more than 5 degrees above average.

The water along the entire coast of Finland has also been very warm even in autumn.

## The autumns have warmed up

September was record warm last year as well. For example, in Kaisaniemi, Helsinki, September of 2023 was the warmest in the station's measurement history.

Last September broke the 1934 record. Last year, the highest temperature in September was 24.1 degrees.
