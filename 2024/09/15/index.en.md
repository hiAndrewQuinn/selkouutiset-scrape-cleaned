Sotkamon's Jymy is the Finnish men's baseball champion. Sotkamo Jymy's victory was secured yesterday Saturday.

2 teams made it to the finals. This year they were Jymy from Sotkamo and Manse PP from Tampere.

Jymy won Mansen, and the Finnish championship went to Sotkamo. Sotkamo's Jymy has now won the Finnish championship 21 times.

In the men's series, Tampere was disappointed, but a week ago there was a celebration in Tampere. That's when Manse PP won the women's Finnish championship. In the women's final games, Manse played against Lapua Virkiä.

This is how this year's Finnish baseball champions are known, and the summer baseball season is over.

## Rules of baseball

Baseball is a team game. There are 2 teams facing each other on the baseball field. Both usually have 12 players.

The teams alternate on the indoor and outdoor courts. In the infield, players hit the ball and make runs. In the outfield, players try to catch the ball and prevent the other team's runs. So baseball looks a bit similar to American baseball.

The rules of baseball are already familiar to Finns from school, because baseball is part of physical education in schools.

## Finland's national game

Baseball is a Finnish game. Lauri \"Tahko\" Pihkala developed baseball a little over 100 years ago.

Baseball became a popular game in different parts of Finland. For many Finns, it is important that the baseball team in their home region is successful.

The highest competition series in baseball is Superpesis. In Superpesis, the teams compete for the Finnish championship.

Baseball is not widely known abroad, but in Finland baseball is the national game. That is why there is fierce competition for the Finnish baseball championship.
