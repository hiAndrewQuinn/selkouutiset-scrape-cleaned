Criminals come to Finland from Sweden. Helsinki police officer Markku Heinikari says that crimes ordered over the internet are serious:

– Swedish criminal groups have taken over the Finnish drug market very strongly. These are the same players who fight among themselves in Sweden.

## Improvements in headlight use

Finally, news about car headlights.

Drivers don't always know how to use their headlights correctly.

Many drivers think that automatic headlights are always correct. However, automatic headlights are not always enough.

If there is fog or rain during the day, for example, the car's tail lights must also be on. Some automatic lights do not have tail lights on during the day. This is illegal in low light and bad weather.

It is certainly correct if the driver turns on the headlights themselves. Then the driver selects the image with the light bulb and lines. Now the car's lights are on in front and behind.
