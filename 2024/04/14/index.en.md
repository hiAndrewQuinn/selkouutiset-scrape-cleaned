Flagging

The topic of the news week is flagging.

There are many flag days in spring in Finland. For example, two days have been ticketed this week, Monday and Tuesday. Do you know what it was flagged for? We will now tell you more about it.

## There are flagging days throughout the year

In Finland, there are flag days all year round, but there are especially many of them in the spring.

For example, this week has been flagged twice. Monday was flagged because it was Roma National Day. On Tuesday, the flag was raised again, because then it was Mikael Agricola's day, i.e. the day of the Finnish language.

A flagpole stands in the yard of almost all Finnish houses. Many summer cottages also have a flag pole. You can check the calendar when the Finnish flag will be raised.

## There are many types of flag days

There are many different flag days in Finland.

There are usually 7 official flag days every year. Then, at least, all government agencies and institutions must raise the flag for impoundment.

Official flag days are, for example, Finland's Independence Day, May Day and Midsummer, Mother's Day and Father's Day.

In addition to the official flag days, there are 15 days a year when it is customary to flag. On these flag days, many famous Finnish people and the things they represented can be remembered.

By flying the flag, we remember, for example, Minna Canth and equality, Aleksis Kive and Finnish literature, and Jean Sibelius and Finnish music.

For example, Finnish nature, Children's rights and Veterans also have their own flag day.

## The flag tells about joy or sadness

In Finland, the ticket can also be picked up in the lock on days other than the day of ticketing. You can, for example, fly a ticket in honor of your own family celebrations such as birthdays or weddings. Flagging is a valuable way to show joy.

Flags also show sadness. When a person dies or a funeral is held in the house, the flag is only drawn at half-mast due to grief.

## Repeat
