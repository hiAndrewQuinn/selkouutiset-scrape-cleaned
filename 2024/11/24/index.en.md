1000 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine

## Already more than 1000 days of war

The topic of the news week is Russia's attack on Ukraine, which has been going on for 1000 days already.

Russia thought it could conquer Ukraine quickly. Ukraine's resistance and Western support surprised Russia. However, the war is becoming increasingly difficult for Ukraine.

We will now tell you more about the war in Ukraine.

## Start of attack

Last Tuesday marked 1,000 days since Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. The attack began on February 24, 2022.

Russian troops tried to capture the capital of Ukraine, Kiev.

However, Ukraine managed to repel Russia's incursion into Kiev. This was a significant thing. Russia could not change the leaders of Ukraine.

## Increase in Russian attacks

Ukraine continues to resist. In August of this year, Ukraine managed to seize territories in the Kursk region from Russia. Later, however, the Ukrainian forces had to retreat on the eastern fronts.

Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian cities and energy facilities. Russia is destroying Ukraine's energy supply because Russia wants the winter to be difficult for Ukraine.

Russia started receiving arms aid first from Iran and this fall also from North Korea. Russia has also received soldiers from North Korea.

## Long range missiles

This week, the US gave Ukraine permission to attack Russia with US long-range missiles. Ukraine has been waiting for such a permit for a long time.

Ukraine used these missiles just this week and hit Russian military targets.

After that, Russia attacked Ukraine with a new big missile.

The USA also promised this week that the USA will give Ukraine anti-personnel mines.

Ukraine fears that US support may decrease when **Donald Trump** becomes US president in January.

## Number of dead

Many ordinary people have died in the war in Ukraine.

The UN calculates that about 12,000 civilians have died and about 25,000 civilians have been wounded in the war in Ukraine.

In reality, the number of dead and wounded civilians is much higher, as reliable information is difficult to obtain from many war zones.

About 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died and perhaps 110,000 to 160,000 Russian soldiers have died.

## Repeat

This time the topic of the news week was the war in Ukraine, which has continued for more than 1,000 days.

Russia has increased its attacks on Ukrainian cities and energy facilities. Russia has also received soldiers from North Korea.

Ukraine has received permission to use US long-range missiles.

Ukraine is worried about whether the new US president will continue to support Ukraine.

This was a news week in plain Finnish. See you again, by the way!
